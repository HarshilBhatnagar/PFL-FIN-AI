In the dynamic realm of financial services, Tata Capital has been continuously evolving to meet the changing
needs of its customers. Through a series of strategic initiatives including technology transformation, service
enhancements, and operational efficiencies, Tata Capital has demonstrated its commitment to innovation and
excellence in all domains.
• Customer Engagement: Launch of New Digital Assets
Tata Capital's digital transformation journey took a significant step with the launch of its new website and

wide range of financial products and services, empowering them with greater convenience, flexibility, and
control over their financial journey.
• SME Lending Revolution: New Loan Origination System
Catering to the needs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Tata Capital introduced a new loan origination
system. This platform streamlines the SME lending process across all ticket sizes, enabling faster approvals,
simplified processes, personalized solutions, and enhanced support for SMEs seeking financial assistance to
fuel their growth and expansion.
• Customer Excellence:
Tata Capital has been constantly enhancing its service delivery through a number of new initiatives. During the
year, multilingual capabilities were added to all service platforms, self-service kiosks were introduced across
branches and a number of new features were added for self-service on mobile and web platforms.
Further, we also upgraded our omnichannel marketing strategy this year by implementing an insights led

the help of it’s advanced analytics and segmentation capabilities, Tata Capital is tailoring its marketing
campaigns, product recommendations, and notifications to individual customer preferences.

Smart automation of operations processes has been a key focus area for Tata Capital. By leveraging

Data analytics plays a pivotal role in Tata Capital's decision-making processes across functions. From credit risk
assessment to marketing strategies, Tata Capital harnesses the power of data analytics to gain actionable
insights and drive business growth in a competitive landscape. The scope of analytics was notably expanded
during the fiscal year, with over 85% of retail loan applications assessed through machine learning based
scorecards. Our data science team played a pivotal role in supporting various functions, including Sales, Risk,
Collections, Wealth Management and HR to name a few, while also focusing on data democratization and
automation of over 200 reports.
Looking ahead, Tata Capital will continue to invest in technology to differentiate itself in the industry. The

11PAST ECHOES TO
MODERN PINGSBrand Initiatives
One of the objectives of the organization has been to increase brand awareness as well as brand
consideration for the Tata Capital brand. The ‘always-on’ media strategy with various digital, social
media and conventional media campaigns has resulted in a steady increase in brand scores over
the last 5 years. This fiscal, the brand sought to take a significant leap forward by implementing a
game-changing strategy aimed at humanizing the brand, increasing visibility among young
demographics, and expanding awareness in new locations. As a key part of this process,
Tata Capital on-boarded a celebrity brand ambassador to support its marketing & communication
initiatives.
The well-known cricketer Shubman Gill was brought in as the brand ambassador for Tata Capital. It
is believed that he would be an excellent fit for the brand with shared values of dynamism,
consistency and dependability, values that Tata Capital also embodies. The leading Brand
Campaign for this Financial Year, “Khoobsurat Chinta”, captured Shubman’s life story where his
father took over all his other worries, allowing Shubman to focus on his “Khoobsurat Chinta”
(“Beautiful” worry) of becoming a cricketer representing India. Through this campaign, consumers
were urged to leave aside their financial worries and focus on their more “beautiful” or interesting
worries, as Tata Capital would take care of all financial worries. The brand campaign also featured a
series of short product films themed around digital, seamless, and quick loans. This FY, the media
presence was also enhanced, with two separate campaigns being aired, both during the cricket
world cup as well as during the Tata Women’s Premier League (WPL). The campaign timings were
picked to increase relevance, given use of the celebrity brand ambassador.
Building on this momentum, Tata Capital captivated audiences during the WPL with on-ground
branding and engaging social media campaigns featuring WPL captains. This season saw a 20%
increase in WPL viewership, boosting brand awareness. Additionally, through the Tata Capital Fan
Box, underprivileged children from the Pankh Scholarship program attended live WPL matches.
Consistent with our media presence strategy, we launched digital product campaigns for Moneyfy,
Home Loans, and Personal Loans, aiming to build brand salience and reach relevant audiences,
thereby increasing web traffic.
On social media, various campaigns connected meaningfully with audiences and increased
customer engagement. Campaigns like 'Suno Sabki Karo Dil Ki' and 'Desh Kaun Chalata Hai'
generated relevant conversations and supported the brand during low-key media months, with
'Desh Kaun Chalata Hai' winning a gold at the E4M Digital Impact Awards. The 'Loan No Loan'
influencer series educated audiences on loan considerations and financial planning, consistently
delivering high engagement in its second year. As a result of all initiatives and campaigns, Tata
Capital achieved highest ever brand awareness and higher ever growth in brand consideration
scores in this fiscal year.
In FY 2024-25, the organization will continue its efforts to maintain a high brand awareness score
and further increase consideration for the brand amongst its consumers. This will involve further
leveraging the association with the brand ambassador and creating and executing campaigns
across conventional, social and digital media channels.

19Message from the
Chairman
Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense pleasure to share my thoughts with you through this letter at the end of an
exciting year at Tata Capital. During FY23-24, we moved further ahead in our journey of fulfilling
India’s aspirations as we consolidated our position as the 3rd largest diversified NBFC in India,
crossed the INR 1 lakh crore yearly disbursals mark, and maintained best-in-class asset quality. We
also secured investment grade international rating of BBB- (equivalent to India’s sovereign rating)
from S&P and Fitch which will help us tap markets globally for raising funds.
We further strengthened our brand presence through continued association with Tata Women’s
Premier League as well as onboarding of Shubman Gill as our brand ambassador.
Coming to the financial performance, your Company was able to generate commendable results on
a consolidated basis during FY23-24. Key highlights include:
• Crossed 1 lakh crore yearly disbursals mark for the first time; up by 40% YoY to INR 1,05,244 crore
• Healthy loan book growth of 35% YoY; INR 1,57,761 crore as of March 2024
• Highest ever profits after tax of INR 3,150 crore; up by 37% YoY (excluding one time items of INR
729 crore in FY23-24)
• Credit cost stood at 0.5% which is amongst the lowest in the industry, signifying our strong asset
quality
• RoE remains healthy at 17.6%
While Tata Capital stands successful across all
key business metrics, we are continuously
working on creating a more sustainable future
through our approach towards responsible
lending. Through our cleantech arm, we have
financed 17GW+ of renewable capacity and
helped to avert 27Mn ton+ carbon emissions
till date.
We at Tata Capital are also taking multiple
initiatives to further the case of financial
inclusion in the country:
• Added 1.2Mn+ new customers aided by
digitization of processes for faster and easier
onboarding
• Opened 285 branches during the year on a
net basis, with most of them in the deeper
markets of the country
• Continued to serve the underserved
through scaling up our microfinance,
affordable housing finance and MSME loan
offerings
At Tata Group, we emphasize on 3S strategy of
simplification, synergy & scale. Accordingly,this year Tata Capital simplified its corporate structure, leveraged synergies with 75+ group
companies and scaled up to cross the INR 1.5 lakh crore Loan book mark.
I firmly believe that financial services will continue to play a crucial role in India’s growth story, with our
GDP growth expected to significantly outpace the global growth in near future. In terms of credit
growth, India’s credit penetration is expected to further accelerate over the next 5 years driven by
factors such as rising middle class which will drive consumption, expected surge in private capex and
Government investments, strong BFSI fundamentals, and the opportunity to capitalize on the
demographic dividend.
Moving into the next fiscal year, I personally am excited to see the growth path ahead of us as we
keep scaling new heights. The demand for credit remains robust supported by a conducive operating
environment and a strong regulatory framework. I also expect the interest rates to moderate over the
next few quarters which will further aid in credit growth. Given our investments in people and
processes as well as availability of a wide range of products, I firmly believe that Tata Capital remains
well positioned for success.
Let’s build together a new India.
Yours sincerely,
Saurabh Agrawal
ChairmanMessage from the
Managing Director & CEO
Dear Shareholders,
First and foremost, let me extend my congratulations to everyone who is associated with Tata Capital, for concluding
FY23-24 with an excellent set of results. Last year remained challenging on multiple counts – be it the prolonged inflation,
the geopolitical risks, weakened global demand, or the rapidly changing regulatory environment. Amidst all these, Tata
Capital grew stronger and continued to deliver a strong operating performance.
During FY23-24, we crossed the coveted INR 1 lakh crore mark with respect to our annual disbursals and the INR 1.5 lakh
crore mark with respect to our loan book. Our book growth of 35% YoY also places us among fastest growing diversified
NBFCs. We also secured investment grade international rating of BBB- (equivalent to India’s sovereign rating) from S&P
Global and Fitch Ratings which will help us further diversify our borrowings.
In FY23-24, Tata Capital continued to expand its product offerings, digital capabilities, and pan-India branch presence in
its endeavour to be the “lender of choice” across customer segments. And, it gives me great joy to say that all these efforts
are reflected in consistent book growth, enhanced profitability and best-in-class asset quality.
Sharing some key highlights of our consolidated performance during FY23-24:
• Disbursals grew by 40% YoY to INR 1,05,244 crore
• Share of Retail & MSME stood at 85%+ of the loan book; as we grow, we aim to retain our book’s granularity and
diversification while focusing on maintaining the share of Retail & SME portfolio at this level
• Despite the high cost of funds, our margins continued to remain robust
• Credit cost stood at 0.5%, down by 10 bps YoY, which is amongst the lowest in the industry
• Continued to maintain strong asset quality, which remains the best amongst peers. As of year-end, the gross NPA & net
NPA stood at 1.5% & 0.4%, respectively
• Achieved highest-ever PAT of INR 3,150 crore;
excluding one-time items reported in FY22-23, PAT
grew by 37% YoY in FY23-24
• Healthy RoE and RoA of 17.6% and 2.4%, respectively
In March 2023, the respective Boards of Tata Capital
Limited (‘TCL’), Tata Capital Financial Services Limited
(‘TCFSL’) and Tata Capital Cleantech Limited (‘TCCL’)
had approved the Scheme of Arrangement (‘Scheme’) to
amalgamate TCFSL and TCCL with TCL. In this regard, I
would like to inform you that effective 1st January 2024
(“Effective Date”), TCFSL and TCCL stand amalgamated
/ merged with TCL pursuant to the approval of the
National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) and other
regulators. With this merger, TCL now stands on a wider
and stronger capital and asset base, having greater
capacity for conducting its operations more efficiently
and competitively.
Now, coming to the key drivers that have been
instrumental in achieving this performance:
Expansion of our offerings
During the year, we continued to expand our product
offerings by venturing into education loans. Educationhas always played a key role in the growth of any economy
and as India moves on its path to becoming the third
largest economy in the world, the emphasis on higher
education is only expected to grow. Going forward,
Tata Capital believes that there is a significant opportunity
in this sector.
In FY23-24, we also ramped up our other recent launches
such as microfinance loans and factoring. Additionally,
during the year, we launched several specialised
products to cater to the unique needs of our customers
such as low-ticket Loan Against Property, secured and
micro business loans, rural individual loans, micro housing
offerings, instant Commercial Vehicle loan, and tier II
channel financing.
Focus on deeper markets
In line with our aspirations to be a part of the India growth
story, we have accelerated our branch expansion during
the year – on an average opening over 5 branches per
week. As of March 2024, our total number of branches
stood at 723, up from 438 as of March 2023, with 92% of
these located in non-metros. This scale-up, along with our
continued investments in digital, have helped us increase
our customer franchise – up from 3.3 million customers as
of March 2023 to 4.5 million as of March 2024.
Focus on margins
With the system liquidity coming down from its
pandemic-led highs and the interest rates remaining
elevated across the globe, several lenders felt the
pressure on their margins during the year. Your Company,
by way of its prudent liability strategy and focusing on its
high-yield product offerings, managed to maintain its
margins. Our focus is to continue growing our
high-margin, sustainable business lines at an
industry-leading pace to improve profitability and
shareholder returns.
Maintaining best-in-class asset quality
We at Tata Capital are cognizant that it is not only
important to grow, but even more important to grow
responsibly. Thus, over the last few years, we have taken
significant steps towards enhancing our analytics-led
underwriting capabilities, inculcating a strong risk culture,
and strengthening our collections backbone. I am happy
to convey that this is well-reflected in the Company’s
asset quality – GNPA at 1.5%, NNPA at 0.4% as of March
2024 – that continues to remain among the best-in-class.
Being Future-ready
The use of technology is at the core of Tata Capital’s
business — and, we believe, potentially the only way to
differentiate and outpace competition. Over the past few
years, we have made concerted efforts to leverage digital
as a business catalyst, an experience driver, and an
efficiency enabler. We have achieved end-to-end
digitalisation of most of our customer journeys, helping us
provide a seamless customer experience and increase
the share of direct-to-customer business. Currently, 97%
of our customers are onboarded through digital platforms,
over 81% of customer service interactions take place
digitally and 92% of collections happen digitally. I am
proud to say that we are a digital-first, data-driven
organisation, and we will continue to invest and create
industry-leading digital platforms and products.
Strengthening the Brand – ‘Tata Capital’
In FY23-24, your Company was elated to onboard Shubman
Gill, one of the leading batsmen in the Indian International
cricket team, as our Brand ambassador. Through our
leading brand campaign, ‘#KhoobsuratChinta’ we
showcased to our customers that, with Tata Capital as
their lending partner, they could leave aside their financial
worries and only focus on their ‘beautiful worries’ such as
becoming proud homeowners, buying their first bike, and
planning their child’s wedding among others.
We also continued our proud partnership with Women’s
Premier League, which completed a successful second
edition in February - March 2024. Through the year, we
continued to engage with our more digital-friendly,
younger customers in our endeavour to become their
trusted partner as they move along various stages of their
lives.
‘Better together’
As I come to the end of my note, I would like to reiterate
one of our key purpose pillars – ‘Better Together’. I firmly
resonate with Mr. Jamsetji Tata’s words – “In a free
enterprise, the community is not just another stakeholder
in business, but is in fact the very purpose of its
existence”. It is, thus, our continuous endeavour to bring
delight to our customers, collaborate with our partners,
nurture our employees, and positively impact lives of the
communities we work with.
It is a testament to each of their contributions that Tata
Capital has now become one of the largest, diversified
NBFCs in the country and living its purpose every day, and
for this, I heartily thank them.
Further, I want to commend each and every one of my
colleagues who have been with us in this journey. Finally, I
would like to extend my gratitude towards our valued
Board for their constant support and to our shareholders
for continuing to place their trust in us.
Yours sincerely,
Rajiv Sabharwal

15. THE TATA CAPITAL BRAND
One of the objectives of the Company has been to increase brand awareness as well as brand
consideration for the T ata Capital brand. The ‘always-on’ media strategy with various digital, social
media and conventional media campaigns has resulted in a steady increase in brand scores over
the last 5 years. During FY 2023-24, the brand took a significant leap forward by implementing a
game-changing strategy aimed at humanizing the brand, increasing visibility among young demographics,
and expanding awareness in new locations. As a key part of this process, T ata Capital on-boarded a
celebrity brand ambassador to support its marketing and communication initiatives.
The well-known cricketer Shubman Gill was brought in as the brand ambassador for T ata Capital. It is
believed that he would be an excellent fit for the brand with shared values of dynamism, consistency
and dependability, values that T ata Capital also embodies. The leading Brand Campaign for this
financial year, “Khoobsurat Chinta”, captured Shubman’s life story where his father took over all his
other worries, allowing Shubman to focus on his “Khoobsurat Chinta” (“Beautiful Worry”) of becoming
a cricketer representing India. Through this campaign, consumers were urged to leave aside their
financial worries and focus on their more “Beautiful” or interesting worries, as T ata Capital would take
care of all financial worries. The brand campaign also featured a series of short product films themed
around digital, seamless and quick loans. During FY 2023-24, the media presence was also enhanced,
with two separate campaigns being aired, both during the cricket world cup as well as during the
Tata Women’s Premier League (“WPL”). The campaign timings were picked to increase relevance,
given use of the celebrity brand ambassador.
37Annual Report 2023-24
Building on this momentum, T ata Capital continued to captivate audiences during the WPL with
on-ground branding integrations and engaging social media campaign featuring the WPL captains. This
season saw a 20% growth on WPL viewership, which in turn was reflected on higher awareness for the
brand. Furthermore, via the T ata Capital Fan Box, underprivileged children from the Pankh Scholarship
program, a T ata Capital Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) initiative, were granted the chance to
attend the WPL live at a stadium.
In addition, in line with the strategy of consistent media presence, digital product campaigns were
launched for several products including Moneyfy, Home Loans, Personal Loans etc. These campaigns
had a twin objective of building brand salience and reaching relevant ‘intender audiences’ and generating
an uptake on web traffic.
On social media, various campaigns were executed through the year with an objective to connect more
meaningfully with audiences and increase customer engagement across social platforms. Campaigns
such as ‘Suno Sabki Karo Dil Ki’ and ‘Desh Kaun Chalata Hai’ served to generate relevant conversations
on social platforms and provided much needed support for the brand in months where other media
activities were low-key. ‘Desh Kaun Chalata Hai” also won a gold at the E4M Digital Impact Awards. In
addition, The ‘Loan No Loan’ influencer series was created to have surrogate conversations about the
brand and the lending category. It educated audiences about considerations round the right time to take
a loan and the right way to financially plan when taking one. The education series featuring Finfluencers
entered its second year, consistently delivering high levels of engagement throughout the year.
As a result of all initiatives and campaigns, T ata Capital achieved highest ever brand awareness and
higher ever growth in brand consideration scores in this fiscal year.
In FY 2024-25, the Company will continue its efforts to maintain a high brand awareness score and
further increase consideration for the brand amongst its consumers. This will involve further leveraging
the association with the brand ambassador and creating and executing campaigns across conventional,
social and digital media channels.

said merger. The Scheme was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the National Company
Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) convened meetings of the shareholders of the Company held on September 15,
2023. The Hon’ble NCLT vide its Order dated November 24, 2023 has sanctioned the Scheme. Upon
receipt of all requisite approvals, TCFSL, TCCL and the Company filed the relevant Forms with the
Registrar of Companies on January 01, 2024. Accordingly, TCFSL and TCCL have amalgamated with
TCL with effect from January 01, 2024 (“Effective date”).
922. ECONOMIC & INDUSTRY SCENARIO
The Indian economy has been consistently outperforming all other leading economies over the last few
years with respect to both GDP growth as well as other macro-economic factors. This is primarily backed
by the government’s strong infrastructure push and slow-but-steady revival in private consumption as
reflected in the uptick in several high frequency indicators such as Index of Industrial Production (‘IIP’),
GST collections, sales of consumer durables, two-wheelers and passenger cars, and system credit and
deposit growth. The economy has also shown significant resilience to external factors such as supply-
chain disruptions, growing geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and weakness in global demand,
further underscoring the strength of its underlying fundamentals.
In FY 2023-24, India continued to surpass all market estimates quarter on quarter and closed the financial
year with 8.2%1 Year on Year (“YoY”) growth. We have also demonstrated strong fiscal consolidation
in recent years with fiscal deficit for FY 2023-24 declining to 5.6%2 (vs originally budgeted at 5.9%3).
Our Monetary Policy Committee (“MPC”) has been successful in navigating the high interest rate
environment and maintaining the retail inflation within its target range of 4-6% in recent months (4.85%4 in
March 2024). India’s external position also remains healthy with forex reserves touching an all-time high of
$651.5 Billion5 providing it with a comfortable import cover. Despite geopolitical uncertainties, Indian
markets have also continued to attract healthy foreign portfolio investment of Rs. 3.4 lakh crore6 in
FY 2023-24. India’s growing importance in international markets is further underscored by JPMorgan’s
announcement regarding India’s inclusion in its emerging market debt index in FY 2024-25.
All of these are reflected in S&P Global Ratings’ upgrade of India’s sovereign rating outlook to ‘positive’
from ‘stable’ while retaining the rating at ‘BBB-’ in May 2024. As per the agency, the rating draws support
from India’s sound economic fundamentals underpinning the growth momentum in the coming years and
the expectation of broad continuity in economic reform and fiscal policies by the government even after
the 2024 elections.
The financial services segment, and in particular NBFCs & HFCs, has been a key facilitator of this
economic growth. Credit growth has remained robust in FY 2023-24 backed by strong demand from
consumers, the Government of India’s (“GoI’s”) push on financial inclusion, and ever-improving
access to credit by way of increasing focus on digitalisation across the industry. We believe that we
have also reached the peak of this rate-hike cycle and may see some cuts towards the later half of
FY 2024-25. These factors, coupled with decade-low Non-Performing Assets (“NPAs”) and an actively
evolving regulatory framework, pave way for healthy double-digit credit growth in the coming years as
well. The growth is likely to be broad-based across segments with some moderation expected in the
unsecured products. While margins may see some pressure due to elevated interest rates in the short
term, overall the sector is expected to report healthy operating performance in over a longer term.
3. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS
The last financial year was a year of strong growth for Tata Capital. The Company continued to see
healthy improvement in operating performance led by its diversified offerings and prudent portfolio mix,
pan-India geographical footprint, robust risk management, and focus on improving margins & productivity.
During the year, the Company was assigned “BBB-” rating (equivalent to India’s sovereign rating) by
global rating agencies - S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings. Further, our domestic credit rating was
reaffirmed at ‘AAA’ by the leading domestic credit rating agencies.

4. RISK MANAGEMENT
Tata Capital Limited alongwith subsidiaries aims to operate within an effective risk management
framework to actively manage all the material risks faced by the organisation and make it resilient to
shocks in a rapidly changing environment. It aims to establish consistent approach in management of
risks and strive to reach the efficient frontier of risk and return for the organisation and its shareholders.
Broad categories of risk faced by the Company are Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Cyber
Security and Reputation Risk. The risk management policies are well defined for various risk categories
supplemented by periodic monitoring through the various sub committees of the Board.
Credit Risk: The credit aspects in the Company are primarily covered by the Credit Policy and Delegation
of Authority approved by the Board of Directors. The Company measures, monitors and manages
credit risks at individual borrower and portfolio level. During the course of the year, the Company has
consistently recalibrated and re-aligned its underwriting criteria with the prevailing market environment
across product lines and the associated digital scorecards, significantly leveraging its risk analytics
capabilities. This helps us in refining our credit decisioning as well as granular monitoring of our existing
portfolio.
Market Risk: Market risk management is guided by clearly laid down policies, guidelines, processes
and systems for the identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting of exposures against various
risk limits. The Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy stipulates a broad framework for liquidity risk
management to ensure that the Company is in a position to meet its liquidity obligations. The ALM Policy
is supplemented by Liquidity Coverage Ratio framework, stress testing and contingency funding plan.
Operational Risk: The Company has put in place a comprehensive system of internal controls, systems
and procedures for documenting, assessing, and periodic monitoring of various risks and controls linked
to various processes across all business lines. The governance and framework for managing operational
risks is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy. Operational Risk Management Department
engages with the First Line of Defense (Business and Operating Units) on periodic basis to identify and
mitigate operational risks to minimise the risk and its impact.
Fraud Risk: TCL has adopted a robust Fraud Risk Management framework. It has an effective and very
strong fraud risk governance mechanism that encompasses controls covering below objectives:
1. 2. 3. Prevent (reduce the risk of fraud from occurring);
Detect (discover fraud when it occurs); and
Respond (take corrective action and remedy the harm caused by fraud).
94Changing business landscape and digitization has heightened the level of fraud risk in the environment
arising due to new methods, schemes and technology. The Company continue to increase its investment
in fraud prevention and detection capabilities to protect our stakeholders.
Compliance Risk: Tata Capital has a robust compliance risk management framework in place guided
by a Board approved Compliance Policy which lays down the roles and responsibilities towards ensuring
compliance with the applicable laws and regulations as also the role of the Compliance Department in
monitoring compliance. The management of compliance risk is an integral component of the governance
framework alongwith other internal control and risk management frameworks.
Cyber Security Risk: The Information Security Policy has been designed to provide an overview
of the information security requirements and describe the controls that may be used to meet those
requirements. It defines the overall framework for information security risk management. It documents
the expected behaviour of system, data and information users. The Cyber Security Policy contains
appropriate approach to combat cyber threats and cyber crisis management plan addressing the aspects:
(i) Detection (ii) Response (iii) Recovery and (iv) Containment.
Reputation Risk: Reputational risk has been defined as the risk arising from negative perception on
the part of customers, shareholders, investors, debt-holders, media reports that can adversely affect an
organization’s ability to maintain existing or establish new business relationships and continued access
to sources of funding.
The Company’s governance culture supported by sound risk management is aimed at ensuring to remain
resilient during challenging periods and forge a sustainable future for the organisation.
The Risk Management Practices of the Company and its subsidiaries are compliant with ISO 31000:2018,
which is the International Standard for Risk Management that lays down Principles, Guidelines and
Framework for Risk Management in the Organization.
5. OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS
The biggest opportunity for financial services sector in India currently lies in the sheer size of the economy.
India is now the 5th largest economy worldwide and well on its way to become the 3rd largest within this
decade. The GoI’s infrastructure push, revival in private capex, growth of the SME ecosystem, increasing
consumer demand, and potential of demographic dividend are all expected to drive this growth. Further,
the current credit penetration in India – Credit to GDP ratio – remains low at ~70% compared to other
larger economies; this is expected to sharply increase over the next decade backed by rapidly developing
digital public infrastructure and a notable improvement in the credit appetite seen across segments. All
of this indicates a significant market opportunity of INR 500 lakh crore+ for all lenders in the country.
With increasing financial inclusion, a large part of this opportunity shall arise from the deeper markets,
where both banks and non-banks have started making significant inroads. This has led to both larger
and smaller players alike to increasingly adopt a ‘phygital’ strategy allowing them to cater to this largely
new-to-credit base in a cost-effective manner, leveraging both physical presence alongwith superior
digital capabilities. Further, the sector is also witnessing a collaboration between incumbents and new
age FinTechs for both capability building as well as distribution that has helped the former to provide their
customers with a seamless experience, creating win-win propositions for all stakeholders involved in the
lending lifecycle.
Over the few years, the regulator has been actively involved in bringing regulations that have strengthened
the sector and improved customer protection. This shall go a long way in enabling innovation and growth
in a responsible manner. In the last year alone, the RBI has introduced multiple guidelines on consumer
credit & bank credit to NBFCs, fair practice code, investments in AIFs, implementation of ‘Key Facts
Statement’ by lenders, etc. This shall also spur both banks and non-banks to conform to highest levels
of corporate governance and compliance standards across the board.
95Annual Report 2023-24
While there’s every reason to be optimistic about India’s growth story, the sector may face some
headwinds in the coming year – elevated cost of funds, margins under pressure, availability of funds for
smaller non-banks, and some moderation in asset quality. While the current macroeconomic environment
has been stable with overall inflation well within the target range since the start of the year, the rate cuts
are not expected to kick-in at least till later part of the year. As a result, margins are expected to remain
under pressure. In addition, the lower-than-expected deposit mobilization for the banks may impact their
borrowing costs as well as their ability to extend credit to various sectors including NBFCs. This may
further impact the non-banks. Furthermore, with recent increase in the unsecured portfolio for several
players, the sector may see some moderation in the asset quality.
Nonetheless, Tata Capital continues to deliver a healthy performance year after year driven by its
purpose to serve responsibly, strong risk management practices across the board and its diversified
liabilities base. The Company has deployed a three-pronged strategy to adapt to the evolving business
and regulatory landscape, and gain a larger foothold in the industry every year. This includes expanding
our product offerings to serve the varied financial needs, doubling down on our presence in deeper
markets, and focusing on bringing customer delight with end-to-end industry-leading digital platforms.
Further, the Company has been focusing on increasing cross-/up sell and enhancing the wallet share
by offering customized solutions to its existing as well as new customers. At all times, we have ensured
strong adherence to the changing regulatory guidelines both in letter and in spirit. Overall, we believe
Tata Capital is well-poised to capitalise on the opportunity ahead on the back of its well-articulated
strategy, its strong technology foundation, best-in-class digital and analytical capabilities, cycle-tested
risk management framework, and strong collections backbone.
6. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
TCL’s internal control system is designed to ensure operational efficiency, protection and conservation
of resources, accuracy and promptness in financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations.
The internal control system is supported by an internal audit process for reviewing the design, adequacy
and efficacy of the Company’s internal controls, including its systems and processes and compliance
with regulations and procedures. Internal Audit Reports are discussed with the Management and are
reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board, which also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of
the internal controls in the Company. TCL’s internal control system is commensurate with its size and the
nature of its operations.
7. INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
The management has laid down IFC framework covering set of standards, processes and structure
across the organization with reference to financial and non-financial controls to ensure that controls
are adequate and are operating effectively. Internal Finance control framework has been established
in line with the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ‘Guidance
Note’).
During FY 2022-23, independent testing was conducted basis process walkthrough and review of
samples as per documented controls in the Risk & Control matrix. Testing is performed for each control
through an independent firm, on behalf of Management confirming adequacy and effectiveness of
controls. During the review there were no material deficiencies or design ineffectiveness of controls was
observed.
Inputs from the Internal Financial control exercise and the Risk & Control matrix is also used by Internal
Audit for their annual planning as part of the Risk Based Internal Audit Policy.
968. HUMAN RESOURCES
The Company had 8,729 permanent employees as of March 31, 2024.
The Company firmly believes that Human Capital is its most important asset. A series of engagement
interventions across identified key themes were undertaken to increase employee morale and the
initiatives focused on key aspects such as physical and mental wellness, celebrations, leadership
engagement sessions, fitness and sports, and family engagement activities.
Continuing with its journey of “Happiness at the workplace”, the Employee Engagement &
Happiness Survey – 2024 was conducted. The Company had an impressive participation rate of 90%
and the Engagement score was 84% which is comparable to the comparative benchmarks identified.
The Company also featured amongst India’s Best WorkplacesTM in BFSI – Top 50 which indicated the
commitment of building a High-Trust, High-Performance Culture.
This survey was an important step in the Company’s journey to create a more positive and an even more
joyful workplace by continuously seeking employee feedback. As a critical step post the survey, action
planning was ensured, and several initiatives are being deployed to further strengthen engagement
across the Company.
Tata Capital has deployed a structured approach to identify, develop and retain top talent. Company has
enhanced its focus on hiring young and diverse workforce from prestigious B schools. The structured
campus programs have enabled to add considerable number of freshers across diverse locations and
functions.
Usage of analytics has increased over the year and the same is playing a key role in manpower
related decisions, like performance appraisals, career progression, talent identification and rewards &
recognition.
The Company continued to deploy robust learning programs through Instructor Led Virtual Training
(“ILVT”) sessions complimented by digital learning to ensure continuous development of the employees.
The Advanced Learning Management System & the Learning App continue to be a central depository
and source to promote anytime, anywhere learning.

99Annual Report 2023-24
Key Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in
our audit
Allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Loan Assets:
Total Loans as at March 31, 2024: ` 1,61,231.08 Crores
ECL Provision as at March 31, 2024: ` 3,253.23 Crores
(Refer Note 7 to the Consolidated financial statements)
Indian Accounting Standard 109
-
Financial Instruments
(‘Ind AS 109’) requires the Company to provide for
impairment of its financial assets using the expected
credit loss (‘ECL’) approach involving an estimation of
probability of loss on such financial assets, considering
reasonable and supportable information about past
events, current conditions and forecasts of future
economic conditions which could impact the credit
quality of the Company’s financial assets. The estimation
of impairment loss allowance on loan assets involves
significant judgement and estimates, which are subject
to uncertainty, and involves applying appropriate
measurement principles in case of loss events.
The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is calculated using
the percentage of probability of default (PD), loss
given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD)
for each of the stages of loan portfolio. Significant
management judgment and assumptions involved
in measuring ECL is required with respect to:
• Segmentation of loan book in buckets
based on common risk characteristics;
• Staging of loans and in particular determining
the criteria, which includes qualitative factors
for identifying a significant increase in credit risk
(i.e. Stage 2) and credit-impaired (i.e. Stage
-
3);
• factoring in future macro-economic and
industry specific estimates and forecasts;
• past experience and forecast data
on customer behaviour on repayments;
• varied statistical modelling techniques to determine
probability of default, loss given default and
exposure at default basis, the default history of loans,
subsequent recoveries made and other relevant
factors using probability-weighted scenarios.
Considering the significance of the above matter
to the financial statements and since the matter
required significant attention to test the calculation
of expected credit losses, we identified this
as a key audit matter for current year audit.”
Our audit procedures in respect of this area
included, but not limited to:
a. Obtained and read Companies policies on
ECL and evaluated the appropriateness of the
Company’s accounting policies for impairment of
financial instruments and assessed compliance
of the same with Indian Accounting Standard
109-Financial Instruments (‘Ind AS 109’) and
ensured such policy is in compliant with the
requirements of the RBI circulars / guidelines;
b. Obtained the policy on moratorium and
restructuring of loans approved by the Board
of Directors pursuant to the RBI circulars/
guidelines.
c. Performed a walkthrough of the impairment
loss allowance process, and assessed the
design and tested operating effectiveness of the
key controls over completeness and accuracy
of the key inputs (including loan book as at
March 31, 2024) and assumptions considered
for calculation, recording and monitoring
of the impairment loss recognized. These
controls, amongst others, included controls
over the allocation of assets into stages along
with passing of journal entries and preparing
disclosures;
d. Obtained an understanding of the modelling
techniques adopted by the Company including
the key inputs and assumptions. Since,
modelling assumptions and parameters were
based on historical data, we assessed whether
historical experience was representative of
current circumstances and was relevant in view
of the recent impairment losses incurred within
the portfolios;
e. Assessed the assumptions used by the Company
for grouping and staging of loan portfolio into
various categories and default buckets and their
appropriateness for determining the probability-
weighted default (PD) and loss-given default
(LGD) rates;
f. Performed sample testing of the input data used
for determining the PD (probability of default)
and LGD (loss given default) rates and agreed
the data with the underlying books of accounts
and records;
g. Tested the arithmetical accuracy of computation
of ECL (expected credit loss) provision
performed by the Company;
100Key Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in
our audit
h. Tested the completeness of loans included in
the ECL calculations as of March 31, 2024 by
reconciling such data with the balances as per
loan book register; and
i. Assessed and validated the adequacy and
appropriateness of the disclosures made by the
management as per the requirements of Ind AS
109 -’Financial Instruments’ in the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Information Technology (“IT”) System and Controls
The Company is dependent on its information
technology (‘IT’) systems due to the significant
number of transactions that are processed daily
across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, IT
application controls are critical to ensure that changes
to applications and underlying data are made in an
appropriate manner and under controlled environment.
Appropriate controls contribute to mitigating the risk
of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to
applications and data. On account of the pervasive
use of IT systems across varied different phases of
business, the testing with respect to general computer
controls of the IT systems used in financial reporting
was identified to be a key audit matter.
The Company has a complex IT architecture to support
its day-to-day business operations. High volume of
transactions is processed and recorded on single or
multiple applications. The reliability and security of IT
systems plays a key role in the business operations
of the Company. Since large volume of transactions
are processed daily, IT controls are required to ensure
that applications process data as expected and that
changes are made in an appropriate manner.
Appropriate IT general controls and application controls
are required to ensure that such IT systems are able to
process the data, as required, completely, accurately
and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
Our audit procedures in respect of this area
included, but not limited to:
a. Involved IT specialists as part of the audit for
the purpose of testing the IT general controls
and application controls (automated and semi-
automated controls) to determine the accuracy
of the information produced by the Company’s
IT systems.
b. Obtained an understanding of the Company’s IT
applications, databases and operating systems
relevant to financial reporting and the control
environment, including an understanding of
the process, mapping of applications and
understanding financial risks posed by people-
process and technology.
c. Tested design and operating effectiveness of
key controls over user access management
(including user access provisioning, de-
provisioning, user access review, password
configuration review and privilege access),
change management (including compliance of
change release in production environment to
the defined procedures), program development
(including review of data migration activity),
computer operations (including testing of key
controls pertaining to, backup, batch processing,
incident management and data centre security).
d. Performed procedures for a selected group of
key controls over financial and reporting system
to determine that these controls remained
unchanged during the year or were changed
following the standard change management
process.
101Annual Report 2023-24
Key Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in
our audit
The Company’s key financial accounting and reporting
processes are highly dependent on information
systems including automated controls in systems,
such that there exists a risk that gaps in the IT control
environment could result in the financial accounting
and reporting records being materially misstated. The
Company uses several systems for its overall financial
reporting. In addition to it, large transaction volumes
and the increasing challenges to protect the integrity of
the Company’s systems and data, we have identified
‘IT systems and automated controls’ as key audit
matter because of the high-level automation, significant
number of systems being used by the management
and the complexity of the IT architecture and its impact
on the financial reporting system.
e. Tested key automated and manual business
cycle controls including testing of alternate
procedures to assess whether there were any
unaddressed IT risks that would materially
impact the financial statements.

6. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s Annual Report but does not include the
consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Other Information is expected
to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
7. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
8. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
9. When we read the Other Information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we
are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s
responsibilities Relating to Other Information’.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
10. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity
and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its Associates in accordance with the accounting
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards specified under section
133 of the Act read with Rules, as amended. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the
companies included in the Group and of its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the
Group and of its associates for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been
used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Management and
102Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
11. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors
of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are responsible for assessing the ability
of the Group and of its associates to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Management
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
12. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
13. 14. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
14.1 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.
14.2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating
effectiveness of such controls.
14.3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the management and Board of Directors.

concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability
of the Group and its associates to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates to cease
to continue as a going concern.
14.5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
103Annual Report 2023-24
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

business activities within the Group and its associates to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the
audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements

that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended
March 31, 2024 and are therefore, the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

Auditor’s Responsibility
4. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements of the Group, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent

assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
7. A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
8. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial
statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are
subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
9. Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of
the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to
subsidiary companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditor of such
subsidiaries incorporated in India. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

(Ind AS) and accounting principles generally accepted in India.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. They are
only offset and reported net when, in addition to having an unconditional legally enforceable right to
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event, the parties also intend to
settle on a net basis.
Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees in crore, which is
also the Group’s functional currency, and all amounts have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs
unless otherwise indicated.
iii. Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for
certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period as
explained in the material accounting policy information below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods
and services at the time of entering into the transaction.

iv. Principles of Consolidation
The Group is able to exercise control over the operating decision of the investee companies,
resulting in variable returns to the Group and accordingly, the same are classified as investment
in subsidiary and line by line consolidation is carried out under the principles of consolidation. The
consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on the following basis:
a) The financial statements of the subsidiaries and associates used in the consolidation are drawn
up to the same reporting date as that of the Group i.e., March 31, 2024, except for certain
associates for which financial statements as on the reporting date are not available. These have
been consolidated based on their latest available financial information. Necessary adjustments
have been made for the effects of significant transactions and other events between the
reporting dates of such financial information and the Consolidated Financial Statements.
b) Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statement of the subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences
until the date on which control ceases. The consolidated financial statements of the Group and
its subsidiaries have been combined on a line-by-line basis by grouping together like items
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, after eliminating intra-group balances, intra-group
transactions and resulting unrealised profits or losses, unless cost cannot be recovered.
c) The excess of cost to the Group of its investments in the subsidiaries over its share of equity
of the subsidiaries, at the dates on which the investments in the subsidiaries were made, is
recognised as “Goodwill on Consolidation” and is tested for impairment on annual basis. On
the other hand, where the share of equity in the subsidiaries as on the date of investment is in
excess of cost of investments of the Group, it is recognised as ‘Capital Reserve’ and shown
under the head ‘Reserves & Surplus’ in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
d) In case of an overseas subsidiary, being a non-integral operation, revenue items are consolidated
at the average rate prevailing during the year. All assets and liabilities are converted at the rates
prevailing at the end of the year. Any exchange difference arising on consolidation is recognised
in the “Foreign Currency Translation Reserve”.
e) Non-controlling interest (NCI) are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s
net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a
subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
f) When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the
former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date of control is lost. Any resulting gain or
loss is recognised in statement of profit and loss.
v. Investments in associates:
a) The Consolidated Financial Statements include the share of profit/ (loss) of associates, which
have been accounted for using the equity method as per Ind AS 28- (Accounting for Investments
in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements). Accordingly, the share of profit/ (loss)
of the associates (the loss being restricted to the cost of the investment) have been added/
deducted to the costs of investments.
b) There are some investments in associates which is made by funds entities, the Group may elect
to measure these investments at Fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IndAS 109.
The Group makes this selection for each associates, at initial recognition of associate.
The difference between the cost of investment in the associate and the share of net assets
at the time of acquisition of shares in the associate is identified in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as Goodwill or Capital Reserve as the case may be and adjusted against the
carrying amount of investment in the associate.

c) d) Items Measurement basis
Certain financial assets and liabilities
(including derivatives instruments)
Net defined benefit (asset)/liability The carrying amount of investment in associates is reduced to recognise impairment, if any,
when there is objective evidence of impairment.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises
any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the
associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and
proceeds from disposal, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss/statement of other
comprehensive income.
vi. Measurement of fair values:
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether
that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics
of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when
pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
A number of the Group’s material accounting policy information and disclosures require the
measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes for certain items in these consolidated
financial statements is determined considering the following measurement methods:
Fair value
Fair value of planned assets less present value of
defined benefit obligations
Value in use under Ind AS 36
Fair values are categorized into different levels (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3) in a fair value hierarchy
based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. When measuring the fair value of an asset or
a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure
the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair
value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the
lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The levels are described as follows:
Level 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the Group can access at the measurement date.
Level 2: inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the valuation of assets or liabilities that the Group can
access at the measurement date.
Valuation model and framework used for fair value measurement and disclosure of financial
instrument.
Refer notes 43(a) & 43(b).
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.

vii. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the
Management of the Group to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported
balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of income and expenses for
the reporting period. The application of material accounting policy information that require critical
accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in
the consolidated financial statements have been disclosed as applicable in the respective notes to
accounts. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Future results could differ from
these estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware
of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their
effect are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgements:
Information about judgements made in applying material accounting policy information that have
most significant effect on the amount recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included
in the following note:
Note ix - classification of financial assets: assessment of the business model within which the assets
are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Assumptions and estimation of uncertainties:
Information about assumptions and estimation of uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting
in a material adjustment in the year ending March 31, 2024 are included in the following notes:
Note xiv - Impairment test of non-financial assets: key assumption underlying recoverable
amounts.
Note xiii - The Group’s EIR methodology: rate of return that represents the best estimate of a
constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given/taken.
Note xiv - Useful life of property, plant, equipment and intangibles.
Note 35 - Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including
amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions.
Note xxiii - Recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about
the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources.
Note xvi - Measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions.
Note 43 - Determination of the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable
inputs.
Note 45 - Impairment of financial instruments: assessment of whether credit risk on the financial asset
has increased significantly since initial recognition, assumptions used in estimating recoverable
cash flows and incorporation of forward-looking information in the measurement of expected credit
loss (ECL).
The weights assigned to different scenarios for measurement of forward looking ECL, i.e. best case,
worst case and base case also requires judgement.

viii. Interest
ix. Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the
principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and
costs, as well as a profit margin.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate (EIR) is
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial
instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.
Calculation of the EIR includes all fees paid or received that are incremental and directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.
Interest income is calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of non-credit impaired
financial assets (i.e. at the amortised cost of the financial asset before adjusting for any expected
credit loss allowance). For credit-impaired financial assets the interest income is calculated by
applying the EIR to the amortised cost of the credit-impaired financial assets {i.e. at the amortised
cost of the financial asset after adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance (ECLs)}. The Group
assesses the collectability of the interest on credit impaired assets at each reporting date. Based on
the outcome of such assessment, the interest income accrued on credit impaired financial assets
are either accounted for as income or written off as per the write off policy of the Group.
The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured on
initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using
the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount
and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.
The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before
adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.
Income not integral to effective interest rate (EIR) method under Ind AS 109 and Income from
services and distribution of financial products:
The Group recognises the fee and commission income not integral to EIR under Ind AS 109 in
accordance with the terms of the relevant customer contracts / agreements and when it is probable
that the Group will collect the consideration for following :
Revenue in the form of income from financial advisory (other than for those items to which Ind
AS 109 - Financial Instruments are applicable) is measured at the transaction price allocated
to the performance obligation, in accordance with Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with
customers.
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers (other than financial assets to which
Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instruments’ is applicable) based on a five step model as set out in Ind AS 115
‘Revenue from contracts with customers’.
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two
or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every
contract that must be met.
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a
contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to
which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a
customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract
that has more than one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each
performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group
expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation.

Fees and commission income
(a) The Group recognises service and administration charges towards rendering of additional
services to its loan customers on satisfactory completion of service delivery. Bounce
charges levied on customers for non-payment of instalment on the contractual date is
recognised on realisation.
(b) Fees on value added services and products are recognised on rendering of services and
products to the customer.
(c) Distribution income is earned by distribution of services and products of other entities
under distribution arrangements. The income so earned is recognised on successful
distribution on behalf of other entities subject to there being no significant uncertainty of its
recovery.
(d) Foreclosure charges are collected from loan customers for early payment / closure of loan
and are recognised on realisation.
(e) Wealth Management Business:
(i) Brokerage / Distribution /Fee Income Bonds / Fixed Deposits / Unlisted Equity / Wills
& Trust / Alternative Investment Funds / International products / External Asset Cross
sell / Other Referral Products : Income is recognised as per the contractual rate on
trade date basis and is exclusive of goods and service tax and securities transaction
tax (STT) wherever applicable.
(ii) Insurance Income : Income is recognised for the commission earned by the Group
on the issuance of policies logged in during the month and confirmed by the Insurers
subject to cancellations done by the customers.
(iii) Income from Mutual Funds : Income is recognised as per the commission specified
in the agreement on daily average assets under management which is provided by
Registrar and Transfer Agents of each Mutual Fund Entities.
(iv) Income from Portfolio Management Services (“PMS”) & Alternative Investment Funds
(“Trail based AIF”):
a. Income from PMS and Trail based AIF is recognised on monthly basis on the
monthly closing assets of each partner and as per the contractual commission
specified in the agreement.
b. c. Processing fees, if any, is recognized on upfront basis in the year of receipt.
Performance based fee, wherever applicable, is recognized as a percentage of
annual profit, in accordance with the terms of the agreement with clients on the
completion of the period.
x. Dividend income
Income from dividend on investment in equity shares of corporate bodies and units of mutual funds
is accounted when the Group’s right to receive dividend is established and it is probable that the
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group and the amount of the dividend
can be measured reliably. Dividend income on financial assets measured at fair value through profit
and loss is presented under Dividend income and not as a part of Net gains/(losses) on fair value
changes.

xi. Leases
Asset given on lease:
Leases are classified as operating lease where significant portion of risks and reward of ownership
of assets acquired under lease is retained by the lessor. Leases of assets under which substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessee are classified as
finance lease.
Assets given under finance lease are recognised as a receivable at an amount equal to the net
investment in the lease. Lease rentals are apportioned between principal and interest on the internal
rate of return. The principal amount received reduces the net investment in the lease and interest is
recognised as revenue.
Lease rental - under operating leases (excluding amount for services such as insurance and
maintenance) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except for increase in line
with expected inflationary cost increases.
Asset taken on lease:
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for properties.
The Group presents right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately on the face of the Balance
sheet. Lease payments (including interest) have been classified as financing cashflows.
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the
initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or
restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any, and
adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated
using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. Right-of-
use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
When a right-of-use asset meets the definition of investment property, it is presented in investment
property.
The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid
at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined,
the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.
The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased
by lease payment made. The carrying amount of lease liability is remeasured to reflect any
reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. A
change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee,
or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is
reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not be exercised.
The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is
a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain
to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease
liabilities and right of use assets recognised. The discounted rate is generally based on incremental
borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated.

xii. Borrowing Cost
Borrowing costs include interest expense calculated using the EIR on respective financial instruments
measured at amortised cost, finance charges in respect of assets acquired on finance lease and
exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings, to the extent they are regarded as
an adjustment to interest costs.
The effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through
the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial liability.
Calculation of the EIR includes all fees paid that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue
of a financial liability.
xiii. Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet on trade date,
i.e. when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs and
revenues that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial
liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or
loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as
appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs and revenues of financial assets or financial
liabilities carried at fair value through the profit or loss account are recognised immediately in the
Statement of Profit or Loss.
Trade Receivables are measured at transaction price.
a) Financial assets
Classification
On initial recognition, depending on the Group’s business model for managing the financial
assets and its contractual cash flow characteristics, a financial asset is classified as measured
at;
(i) Amortised cost;
(ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); or
(iii) Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets
and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent
to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Group changes its business model for
managing financial assets.
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method if it
meets both of the following conditions and is not recognised as at FVTPL:
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably
elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI (designated as
FVTOCI - equity investment). This election is made an investment - by - investment basis.
131Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All financials assets not classified and measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI as described
above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate the
financials assets that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at
FVTOCI or at FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces the accounting mismatch
that would otherwise arise.
Business model assessment
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial
asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and
information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
-
The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in
practice.
-
How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s
management;
-
The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held
within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
-
The frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons
for such sales and expectation about future sales activity.
-
How managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether the compensation is based
on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).
At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Group determines whether newly recognized
financial assets are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect a new business
model. The Group reassess its business models each reporting period to determine whether
the business models have changed since the preceding period.
Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
(SPPI)
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset
on initial recognition. That principal amount may change over the life of the financial assets (e.g.
if there are payments of principal). Amount of ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time
value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during
a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and
administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest,
the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether
the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of
contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment,
the Group considers:
-
Contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
-
Terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate
features;
-
-
Prepayment and extension features; and
Terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets.
132NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
Contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that
are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or
commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are SPPI.
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if
the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early
termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount
or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an
amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid)
contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early
termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature
is insignificant at initial recognition.
Subsequent measurement and gains and losses:
Financial assets
at FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and
losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in the
statement of profit or loss. The transaction costs and fees are also recorded
related to these instruments in the statement of profit and loss.
Financial assets
at amortised
cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment
losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment
are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Any gain or loss on de-
recognition is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Financial
assets (other
than Equity
Investments) at
FVTOCI
Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is
achieved by both, selling financial assets and collecting contractual cash
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, are subsequently
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value
movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI).
Interest income measured using the EIR method and impairment losses, if
any are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition,
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from
the equity to 'other income' in the statement of Profit and Loss.
Equity
investments at
FVTOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are
recognised as income in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the
dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not reclassified
to profit or loss.
Reclassifications within classes of financial assets
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period
after the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets. The classification
and measurement requirements of the new category apply prospectively from the first day of
the first reporting period following the change in business model that result in reclassifying the
Group’s financial assets.

Impairment of Financial Asset
Impairment approach
Overview of the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) principles
The Group records allowance for expected credit losses for all loans (including those classified
as measured at FVTOCI), together with loan commitments, in this section all referred to as
‘financial instruments’ other than those measured at FVTPL. Equity instruments are not subject
to impairment under Ind AS 109.
The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the
lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit
risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit
loss (12m ECL). The Group’s policies for determining if there has been a significant increase in
credit risk are set out in Note 45.
The 12m ECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events
on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.
Both LTECLs and 12m ECLs are calculated on an individual/portfolio basis- having similar risk
characteristic, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments.
The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting
period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial
recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of
the financial instrument.
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage
3, as described below:
Stage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12m
ECLs. This also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been
reclassified from Stage 2.
Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group
records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk
has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty
fails to make the contractual payments within 90 days of when they fall due. Accordingly, the
financial assets shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the reporting date, it has been 90 days past
due. Further if the customer has requested forbearance in repayment terms, such restructured,
rescheduled or renegotiated accounts are also classified as Stage 3. Non-payment on another
obligation of the same customer is also considered as a stage 3. Defaulted accounts include
customers reported as fraud in the FRMC. Once an account defaults as a result of the DPD
condition, it will be considered to be cured only when entire arrears of interest and principal are
paid by the borrower. The Group records an allowance for the LTECLs.
Undrawn loan commitments
Undrawn loan commitments are commitments under which, over the duration of the commitment,
the Group is required to provide a loan with pre-specified terms to the customer. Undrawn loan
commitments are in the scope of the ECL requirements.
134NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial guarantee contract
A financial guarantee contract requires the Group to make specified payments to reimburse
the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in
accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are initially measured at their fair values
and, if not designated as at FVTPL and not arising from a transfer of a financial asset, are
subsequently measured at the higher of:
• the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance with Ind AS 109; and
• the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income
recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policies. The Group has
not designated any financial guarantee contracts as FVTPL.
Group’s ECL for financial guarantee is estimated based on the present value of the expected
payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The shortfalls are discounted
by the interest rate relevant to the exposure.
The Measurement of ECLs
The Group calculates ECLs based on a probability-weighted scenario to measure the expected
cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference
between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash
flows that the entity expects to receive.
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:
Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default
over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed
period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio.
Exposure at Default (EAD): The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future
default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date,
including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise,
expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.
Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case
where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual
cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation
of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD.
Impairment losses and releases are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification
losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying
value
When estimating LTECLs for undrawn loan commitments, the Group estimates the expected
portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is
then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn
down, based on a probability-weightage. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted at an
approximation to the expected EIR on the loan.
The above calculated PDs, EAD and LGDs are reviewed and changes in the forward looking
estimates are analysed during the year.
135Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The mechanics of the ECL method are summarised below:
Stage 1 The 12 months ECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs
that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12
months after the reporting date. These expected 12-months default probabilities are
applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD.
Stage 2 When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group
records an allowance for the LTECLs. The mechanics are similar to those explained
above, but PDs and LGDs are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected
cash shortfalls are discounted by an contractual or portfolio EIR as the case may be
Stage 3 For loans considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the lifetime expected credit
losses for these loans. The method is similar to that for stage 2 assets, with the PD set
at 100%.
In ECL model the Group relies on broad range of forward looking information for economic
inputs.
The Group recognises loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) on all financial assets
at amortised cost that are debt instruments, debt financial assets at fair value through other
comprehensive income, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. No impairment
loss is recognised on equity investments.
When determining whether credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Group considers reasonable and
supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes
both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, including on historical experience and
forward-looking information (Refer Note 43).
Impairment of Trade receivable and Operating lease receivable
Impairment allowance on trade receivables is made on the basis of life time credit loss
method, in addition to specific provision considering the uncertainty of recoverability of certain
receivables.
Write-off
Impaired loans and receivables are written off, against the related allowance for loan impairment
on completion of the Group’s internal processes and when the Group concludes that there is no
longer any realistic prospect of recovery of part or all of the loan. For loans that are individually
assessed for impairment, the timing of write off is determined on a case by case basis. A write-
off constitutes a de-recognition event. The Group has a right to apply enforcement activities to
recover such written off financial assets. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written
off are credited to the statement of profit and loss.
Collateral valuation and repossession
To mitigate the credit risk on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible
as per the powers conferred on the Non Banking Finance Companies under the Securitisation
and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002
(“SARFAESI”).
The Group provides fully secured, partially secured and unsecured loans to individuals and
Corporates. In its normal course of business upon account becoming delinquent, the Group
physically repossess properties or other assets in its retail portfolio. Any surplus funds are
returned to the customers/obligors. As a result of this practice, the residential properties,
vehicles, plant and machinery under legal repossession processes are not recorded on the
balance sheet and not treated as non–current assets held for sale unless the title is also
transferred in the name of the Group.

Modification and De-recognition of financial assets
Modification of financial assets
A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows
of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between initial recognition and
maturity of the financial asset. A modification affects the amount and/or timing of the contractual
cash flows either immediately or at a future date. The Group renegotiates loans to customers
in financial difficulty to maximise collection and minimise the risk of default. A loan forbearance
is granted in cases where although the borrower made all reasonable efforts to pay under the
original contractual terms, there is a high risk of default or default has already happened and
the borrower is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms in most of
the cases include an extension of the maturity of the loan, changes to the timing of the cash
flows of the loan (principal and interest repayment), reduction in the amount of cash flows due
(principal and interest forgiveness). Such accounts are classified as stage 3 immediately upon
such modification in the terms of the contract.
Not all changes in terms of loans are considered as renegotiation and changes in terms of a
class of obligors that are not overdue is not considered as renegotiation and is not subjected to
deterioration in staging.
De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is derecognised when:
(a) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
(b) the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or the Group has neither transferred
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, but has
transferred control of the asset.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial
asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised
borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset
(or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of
(i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability
assumed) and
(ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated
as at FVTOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest
in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the
Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
137Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial liability, Equity and Compound Financial Instruments
Debt and equity instruments that are issued are classified as either financial liabilities or as
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity
after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at the amortised cost using the effective
interest method, unless at initial recognition, they are classified as fair value through profit and
loss. Interest expense are recognised in the Statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on
derecognition is also recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are
potentially unfavourable to the Group or a contract that will or may be settled in the Group’s own
equity instruments and is a non-derivative contract for which the Group is or may be obliged to
deliver a variable number of its own equity instruments, or a derivative contract over own equity
that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash (or another
financial asset) for a fixed number of the Group’s own equity instruments.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial liability as “Financial liability measured at amortised cost”
except for those classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss
(FVTPL).
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the
financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or
loss.
Equity
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity
after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. A conversion option that will be settled by the
exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Group’s
own equity instruments is an equity instrument.
No gain/loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the
Group’s own equity instruments.
Treasury shares
When any entity within the Group purchases the company’s ordinary shares, the consideration
paid including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total
equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued. When treasury shares are sold or reissued
subsequently, the amount received is recognized as an increase in equity, and the resulting
surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to/from securities premium.
138NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
b) Derivative Financial Instruments
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate
risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for
separately if certain criteria are met.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into
and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting
gain/loss is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income immediately unless
the derivative is designated and is in-effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in the statement of profit and loss depends on the nature of the hedge
relationship.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in
cash flows associated with its floating rate borrowings arising from changes in interest rates and
exchange rates.
At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the
changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each
other.
c) Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other
equity under ‘effective portion of cash flows hedges’. The effective portion of changes in the
fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair
value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge.
Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in
statement of profit and loss.
The Group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange
contracts as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedge relationships. The change in fair value
of the forward element of the forward exchange contracts (‘forward points’) is separately
accounted for as cost of hedging and recognised separately within equity.
If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold,
expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If
the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been
accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified to statement of profit and loss.
Cash, Cash equivalents and bank balances
Cash, Cash equivalents and bank balances include fixed deposits, margin money deposits, and
earmarked balances with banks which are carried at amortised cost.

xiv. Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
a) PPE
Property, plant and equipment acquired by the Group are reported at acquisition cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and estimated cost of dismantling
and removing the item and restoring the site on which its located if any. However estimated
cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which its located does not
arise for leased assets since the same are borne by the lessee as per the lease agreement.
The acquisition cost includes any cost attributable for bringing an asset to its working condition
net of tax/duty credits availed, which comprises of purchase consideration and other directly
attributable costs of bringing the assets to their working condition for their intended use. PPE is
recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on
PPE after its purchase is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits will
flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
b) Capital work-in-progress
PPE not ready for the intended use on the date of the Balance Sheet are disclosed as “capital
work-in-progress” and carried at cost, comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses and
attributable interest.
c) Other Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that
are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured
reliably. Intangible assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any,
less accumulated amortisation and cumulative impairment. Administrative and other general
overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to the acquisition of intangible assets are
allocated and capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible assets. Expenses on software
support and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year in
which such costs are incurred.
d) Intangible assets under development
Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as
“Intangible assets under development”.
e) Depreciation and Amortisation
Depreciable amount for tangible property, plant and equipment is the cost of an asset, or other
amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual value. The residual value of each asset
given on Operating lease is determined at the time of recording of the lease asset. If the residual
value of the Operating lease asset is higher than 5%, the Group has a justification in place for
considering the same.
Depreciation on tangible property, plant and equipment deployed for own use has been provided
on the straight-line method as per the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies
Act, 2013 except in respect of buildings, equipment and vehicles, in whose case the life of the
assets has been internally assessed based on the nature of the asset, the estimated usage
of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, etc. Based
on internal assessment, depreciation on tangible property, plant and equipment deployed on
operating lease has been provided on the straight-line method over the primary lease period
of the asset. Depreciation method is reviewed at each financial year end to reflect expected
pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated
useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each financial year end with the effect of
any change in the estimates of useful life/residual value is accounted on prospective basis.
140NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Depreciation for additions to/deductions from owned assets is calculated pro rata to the
remaining period of use. Depreciation charge for impaired assets is adjusted in future periods
in such a manner that the revised carrying amount of the asset is allocated over its remaining
useful life. All capital assets with individual value less than Rs. 5,000 are depreciated fully in the
year in which they are purchased.
Purchased software / licenses are amortised over the estimated useful life during which the
benefits are expected to accrue. The method of amortisation, residual value and useful life are
reviewed at the end of each accounting year with the effect of any changes in the estimate
being accounted for on a prospective basis. Amortisation on impaired assets is provided by
adjusting the amortisation charge in the remaining periods so as to allocate the asset’s revised
carrying amount over its remaining useful life.
Estimated useful life of Owned assets considered by the Group are:
Asset Estimated Useful Life
Leasehold Improvements As per lease period
Furniture and Fixtures 10 years
Computer Equipment 4 years
Office Equipment 5 years
Vehicles 4 years
Software Licenses 1 to 15 years
Buildings / Investment Property 25 years
Plant & Machinery 10 years
Leased assets: as per the lease period
f) Investment property
Properties held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as Investment
properties and measured and reported at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition its measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. When the use of an existing property changes from owner-occupied to investment
property, the property is reclassified as investment property at its carrying amount on the date
of reclassification.
When there is a change in use of an existing property classified as investment property
evidenced by commencement of owner occupation, the property is reclassified as property,
plant & equipment at its carrying amount on the date of reclassification.
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is
permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the
disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of property is recognised in the Statement
of Profit and Loss in the same period.
g) Impairment of assets
Upon an observed trigger, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PPE, investment
property and intangible asset to determine whether there is any indication that the asset
have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the PPE, investment property and
intangible assets are tested for impairment so as to determine the impairment loss, if any.
Impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not
been adjusted.
141Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
If recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, such deficit is
recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss as impairment loss and the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
xv. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount so that the increased carrying amount does
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
is recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
h) De-recognition of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss
arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE is determined as the difference between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of
Profit and Loss. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic
benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of
an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Non-Current Assets held for sale:
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered
principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset is available for
immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of
such asset and the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed
sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and
fair value less costs to sell.
The Group has a policy to make impairment provision at one third of the value of the Asset for each
year upon completion of three years up to the end of five years based on the past observed pattern
of recoveries. Losses on initial classification as Held for sale and subsequent gains & losses on
Remeasurement are recognised in Statement of Profit and loss. Once classified as Held for sale,
the assets are no longer amortised or depreciated.
xvi. Employee Benefits
Defined Contribution benefits include superannuation fund.
Defined Employee benefits include gratuity fund, provident fund compensated absences and long
service awards.
Defined contribution plans
The Group’s contribution to superannuation fund is considered as defined contribution plan and is
charged as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss based on the amount of contribution
required to be made and when services are rendered by the employees.
Defined benefit plans
The Group makes Provident Fund contributions, a defined benefit plan for qualifying employees.
Under the Schemes, both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a specified
percentage of the covered employees’ salary (currently 12% of employees’ salary). The contributions,
except that the employer’s contribution towards pension fund is paid to the Regional Provident Fund
office, as specified under the law, are made to the provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by
Tata Capital Limited (“the ultimate parent Company”).
142NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The interest rate payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest
declared by the Central Government under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous
Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall on account of , if any, shall be made good by the Group. Hence
the Group is liable for annual contributions and any deficiency in interest cost compared to interest
computed based on the rate of interest declared by the Central Government. The total liability in
respect of the interest shortfall of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation. The
interest liability arising only to the extent of the aforesaid differential shortfalls is a defined benefit
plan. There is no such shortfall as at March 31, 2024.
Short-term employee benefits
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for
the services rendered by employees are recognised during the year when the employees render
the service. These benefits include performance incentive and compensated absences which are
expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the reporting period in which the employee
renders the related service.
The cost of short-term compensated absences is accounted as under:
(a) in case of accumulated compensated absences, when employees render the services that
increase their entitlement of future compensated absences; and
(b) in case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur.
Other long-term employee benefits
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the
year in which the employee renders the related service are recognised as a liability at the present
value of the defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets
out of which the obligations are expected to be settled. Long term service awards are recognised as a
liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date.
The obligation is measured on the basis of actuarial valuation using Projected unit credit method and
Remeasurement gains/ losses are recognised in P&L in the period in which they arise.
Share based payment transaction
The stock options granted to employees pursuant to the company’s Stock Options Schemes, are
measured at the fair value of the options at the grant date as per Black and Scholes model. The fair
value of the options is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost, with a
corresponding increase in other equity, over the vesting period on a straight line basis. The amount
recognised as expense in each year is arrived at based on the number of grants expected to vest.
If a grant lapses after the vesting period, the cumulative discount recognised as expense, with a
corresponding increase in other equity, in respect of such grant is transferred to the General reserve
within other equity.
xvii. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency are recorded on initial
recognition using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign
currency monetary items are reported at the rates prevailing at the year end. Non-monetary items
that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
Functional currency of the Group and foreign operations has been determined based on the primary
economic environment in which the Company and its foreign operations operate considering the
currency in which funds are generated, spent and retained.
Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items
at each Balance Sheet date at the closing spot rate are recognised in the Statement of Profit and
Loss in the period in which they arise.

xviii. Operating Segments
The Group’s main business is financing by way of loans for retail and corporate borrowers in India.
The Group’s operating segments consist of “Financing Activity”, “ Investment Activity” and “Others”.
All other activities of the Group revolve around the main businesses. This in the context of Ind AS
108 - operating segments reporting are considered to constitute reportable segment. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) of the Group is the Board of Directors along with Managing
Director. Operating segment disclosures are consistent with the information reviewed by the
CODM.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it
may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions
with any of the Group’s other components, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Accordingly, all operating segment’s operating results of the Group are reviewed regularly by the
Board of Directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess
their performance.
The “Financing Activity” segment consists of asset financing, term loans (corporate and retail),
channel financing, credit substitutes, investments linked to/arising out of lending business and
bill discounting. The “Investment Activity” segment includes corporate investments and “Others”
segment primarily includes advisory services, wealth management, distribution of financial products
and leasing.
Revenue and expense directly attributable to segments are reported under each operating segment.
Expenses not directly identifiable to each of the segments have been allocated to each segment on
the basis of associated revenues/expenses of each segment. All other revenue and expenses which
are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as un-allocable expenses.
Assets and liabilities that are directly attributable to segments are disclosed under each reportable
segment. All other assets and liabilities are disclosed as un-allocable.
xix. Investments in associates
The Group has elected to measure investment in associate at cost as per Ind AS 27 - Separate
Financial Statements, accordingly measurement at fair value through statement of profit and loss
account and related disclosure under Ind AS 109 does not apply.
xx. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income attributable to owners of the Group
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid up equity share is
included as fully paid equivalent according to the fraction paid up.
Diluted earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares and dilutive
potential shares, except where the result would be anti-dilutive.
xxi. Taxation
Income Tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognized in the
Statement of Profit and Loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity when they relate to
items that are recognized in the respective line items.
Current Tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the
year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount
of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after
considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax
law) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
144NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the
recognised amounts and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or
simultaneously.
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and
unutilized business loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused
tax credits could be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/
reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit
will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net
basis.
xxii. Goods and Services Input Tax Credit
Goods and Services Input tax credit is accounted for in the books in the period in which the supply
of goods or service received is accounted and when there is no uncertainty in availing/utilising the
credits.
xxiii. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the Group determines the level
of provision by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates
specific to the liability. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Statement of Profit
and Loss net of any reimbursement.
Contingent assets/liabilities
A possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the
control of the Group or; present obligation that arises from past events where it is not probable that
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or the
amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability are disclosed as contingent
liability and not provided for. Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits
is probable. Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
Where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic
benefits expected to be received under such contract, the present obligation under the contract is
recognised and measured as a provision.

xxv. Statement of Cash Flows
Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating the cash flows into operating, investing and
financing activities. Cash flow from operating activities is reported using indirect method adjusting
the net profit for the effects of:
(a) Changes during the period in operating receivables and payables transactions of a non-cash
nature;
(b) Non-cash items such as depreciation, Impairment, deferred taxes, unrealised foreign currency
gains and losses, and undistributed profits of associates and joint ventures; and
(c) All other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents (including bank balances) shown in the Statement of Cash Flows
exclude items which are not available for general use as on the date of Balance Sheet.
xxvi. Dividend payable
Interim dividend declared to equity shareholders, if any, is recognised as liability in the period in
which the said dividend has been declared by the Board of Directors. Final dividend declared, if any,
is recognised in the period in which the said dividend has been approved by the Shareholders.
The dividend payable is recognised as a liability with a corresponding amount recognised directly in
equity.
Cumulative Redeemable Preference shares (CRPS) is classified as a financial liability as per Ind AS
109 and dividend accrued on such instrument is recorded as Finance cost.
xxvii. Business combinations of entities under common control
Business combinations involving entities that are controlled by the Group are accounted for using
the pooling of interest method. Assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their
carrying value without adjustments being made to reflect fair values. The identity of the reserve are
preserved and reserve of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee. The difference, if
any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued and the amount of share capital of the
transferor is transferred to capital reserve. The financial information in the financial statements in
respect of prior period is restated as if the business combination had occurred form the beginning of
the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination.
xxviii. Recent accounting pronouncements
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year
ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing
standards applicable to the Group.

All hedges are 100% effective i.e. there is no ineffectiveness (refer note 45)
5.4 Hedge Ratio: There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
as the terms of the forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps contract match
that of the foreign currency borrowings. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging
relationships as the underlying risk of the forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency
swaps are identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the
dollar offset method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the
changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The hedge ineffectiveness can
arise mainly if there is a change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty.

Subsidiaries of Tata Capital Limited’s undistributed reserves which, if paid out as dividends, would be
subject to tax in the hands of recipient. An assessable temporary difference exists, but no deferred tax
liability has been recognized as Tata Capital Limited is able to control the timing of distribution from these
subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are not expected to distribute the dividend out of these reserves in the
foreseeable future. Also there are no plans to sell any of the subsidiaries in the foreseeable future and
hence no deferred tax liability has been created on the basis of capital gains tax.

amount liable by Tata Capital Housing Finance Limited is ` 81 crore as at March 31, 2024 (As at

on invocation is capped at the outstanding amount.
As at March 31, 2024, claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts in respect of income
tax matters amounted to ` 220.97 crore. These claims against the Company are arising on account of
multiple issues of disallowances on completion of assessment proceedings under the Income-tax Act,
1961, such as disallowance of expenditure incurred in relation to income not includible in total income
u/s 14A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and disallowance of interest expenditure on perpetual NCDs.These
matters are pending before various appellate authorities and the Management expect that its position
will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position. Hence, the Company has not recognized these uncertain tax positions in its books.

Note 36: Employee benefit expenses
A. Defined contribution plans
1) Superannuation Fund
The Group makes contribution towards superannuation fund, a defined contribution retirement plan
for qualifying employees. The Superannuation fund is administered by superannuation fund set
up as Trust by the Group. The Group is liable to pay to the superannuation fund to the extent of
the amount contributed. The Group recognizes such contribution as an expense in the year of
contribution. The Group has recognised ₹ 1.70 crore (Year ended 31 March 2023 ₹ 1.67 crore) for
Superannuation Fund contributions in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
B. Defined benefit plans
1) Provident Fund
The Group makes Provident Fund contributions, a defined contribution plan for qualifying employees.
Under the Schemes, both employees and the Group make monthly contributions at a specified
percentage of the covered employees’ salary (currently 12% of employees’ basic salary). The
contributions are made to the provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Group, except
for one of its subsidiaries where contributions as specified under the law are paid to provident fund
administered by the Regional Provident Fund Commisisoner.
The employer’s contribution towards pension fund is paid by the Group to Regional Provident Fund
office, as specified under the law.
The interest rate payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate
of interest declared by the Central Government under the Employees Provident Funds and
Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Group. Hence
the Group is liable for annual contributions and any deficiency in interest cost compared to interest
computed based on the rate of interest declared by the Central Government. The total liability in
respect of the interest shortfall of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation. The
interest liability arising only to the extent of the aforesaid differential shortfalls is a defined benefit
plan. There is no such shortfall as at March 31, 2024.
The Provident Fund contributions along with the interest shortfall if any are recognized as an
expense in the year in which it is determined. The Group has recognised ₹ 58.37 crore (Year ended
31 March 2023 ₹ 43.09 crore) for Provident Fund contributions and ₹ Nil (Year ended 31 March 2023
₹ Nil) for interest shortfalls in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
215Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2) Gratuity
The Group offers its employees defined benefit plans in the form of a gratuity scheme (a lump-sum
amount). Benefits under the defined benefit plans are typically based on years of service and the
employee’s compensation (generally immediately before retirement). The gratuity scheme covers
substantially all regular employees. Commitments are actuarially determined at year-end. These
commitments are valued at the present value of the expected future payments, with consideration for
calculated future salary increases, using a discount rate corresponding to the interest rate estimated
by the actuary having regard to the interest rate on Government bonds with a remaining term that is
almost equivalent to the average balance working period of employees. Actuarial valuation is done
based on “Projected Unit Credit” method. Gains and losses of changed actuarial assumptions are
recorded in the Other Comprehensive Income. The Company provides gratuity for employees in
India as per payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
The gratuity scheme for employees is as under:
Continuous service for 5 years (not applicable in case of death or
disability while in service)
Benefit payable upon Retirement, Withdrawal, Death/Diability
For service less than 10 years: 15/26 X Salary X Service For service
greater than 10 years: Salary X Service
Salary definition Last drawn monthly basic salary + Dearness Allowance
Service definition Number of years of service rounded to the nearest integer
Normal retirement age 60 years
Eligibility Benefit payable There are no statutory minimum funding requirements for gratuity plans mandated in India. However,
a Company can fund the benefits by way of a separate irrevocable Trust to take advantage of tax
exemptions and also to ensure security of benefits.
The Tata Capital Limited Gratuity Scheme is funded by way of a separate irrevocable Trust and the
Company is expected to make regular contributions to the Trust. The fund is managed internally by
the Company and the assets are invested as per the pattern prescribed under Rule 67 of Income Tax
Rules, 1962. The asset allocation of the Trust is set by Trustees from time to time, taking into account
the membership profile, the liquidity requirements of the plan and risk appetite of the plan sponsor as per
the investment norms. Each year asset-liability matching study is performed in which the consequences
of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and
Contribution policies are integrated within this study.
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of
which are detailed below:
1. 2. 3. Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government
bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
Salary Inflation risk : Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit
obligation
Demographic risk : This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements
that include mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on
the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and depends upon the combination of salary
increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals because in
the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year
as compared to a long service employee.
216NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4. 5. Investment risk : For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets
certified by the insurer may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases,
the present value of the assets is independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide
fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount rate
during the inter-valuation period.
Legislative risk : Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan
assets due to change in the legislation/regulation. The government may amend the Payment of
Gratuity Act, 1972, thus requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to the employees. This
will directly affect the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the same will have to be
recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is effective.

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 43: Fair values of financial instruments
See accounting policy in Note 2(xiii)
A. Valuation models
a) b) c) The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance
of the inputs used in making the measurements:
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Group can access at measurement date.
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments
valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical
or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in
which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the valuation of assets or liabilities that the Group can
access at measurement date. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique
includes inputs that are not observable and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for
similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect
differences between the instruments. Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted
cash flow models, income approach, comparison with similar instruments for which observable market
prices exist, option pricing models and other valuation models. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation
techniques include risk-free returns, benchmark interest rates and credit spreads used in estimating
discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and equity index prices
and expected price volatilities and correlations.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price
that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses widely recognised valuation models to determine the fair value of financial instruments,
such as forward rate agreement, that use only observable market data and require little management
judgement and estimation. Observable prices or model inputs are usually available in the market for
listed equity securities. The availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the
need for management judgement and estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with
determining fair values.
For more complex instruments, the Group uses proprietary valuation models, which are usually developed
from recognised valuation models. Some or all of the significant inputs into these models may not be
observable in the market, and may be derived from market prices or rates or estimated based on
assumptions. Valuation models that employ significant unobservable inputs require a higher degree
of management judgement and estimation in the determination of fair value. Management judgement
and estimation are usually required for the selection of the appropriate valuation model to be used,
determination of expected future cash flows on the financial instrument being valued, determination
of the probability of counterparty default and prepayments, determination of expected volatilities and
correlations and selection of appropriate discount rates.
Fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or
model uncertainties, to the extent that the Group believes that a third party market participant would take
them into account in pricing a transaction. Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include
adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group and the counterparty where appropriate.
Model inputs and values are calibrated against historical data, where possible, against current or recent
observed transactions in different instruments. This calibration process is inherently subjective and it
yields ranges of possible inputs and estimates of fair value, and management uses judgement to select
the most appropriate point in the range.
260NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Discounting of the cash flows of financial asset/ financial liability for computing the fair value of such
instrument: the future contractual cash flows of instrument over the remaining contractual life of the
instrument are discounted using comparable rate of lending/borrowing as applicable to financial asset/
financial liability in the month of reporting for a similar class of instruments. For shorter tenure financial
assets such as channel finance, the remaining tenure is assumed to be six months.
Derivatives held for risk management:
The Group enters into derivatives to mitigate the currency exchange risk and interest rate risk on
account of fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates and floating rates towards the principal and interest
repayments of external commercial borrowing. Some of these instruments are valued using models
with significant unobservable inputs, principally expected long-term volatilities and expected correlations
between different underlyings.
In the valuation of derivative instruments, the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method plays a pivotal role.
This method involves projecting the future cash flows that the derivative is expected to generate or
obligate over its life. These cash flows are then discounted back to the present value using an appropriate
discount rate, which reflects the risk profile of the cash flows and the time value of money.
The discount rate is typically derived from market-based inputs to ensure an objective valuation. In the
context of derivatives, the DCF method accounts for various factors such as underlying asset price
movements, interest rate changes, and volatility, as well as contractual terms of the derivative. The
strength of the DCF approach lies in its flexibility to model the unique features of derivatives, including
embedded options.

The Group has a established a policy for the measurement of fair values addressing the requirement to
independently verify the results of all significant fair value measurements. Specific controls include:
1) 3) 4) 5) 6) verification of observable pricing basis actual market transactions;
2) re-performance of model valuations;
a review and approval process for new models and changes to models
annual calibration and back-testing of models against observed market transactions;
analysis and investigation of significant annual valuation movements; and
review of significant unobservable inputs, valuation adjustments and significant changes to the fair
value measurement of Level 3 instruments compared with the previous year.
When third party information, such as valuation agency report is used to measure fair value, the Group
assesses the documents and evidence used to support the conclusion that the valuations meet the
requirements of Ind AS. This includes:
1) understanding how the fair value has been arrived at, the extent to which it represents actual market
transactions and whether it represents a quoted price in an active market for an identical instrument;
2) when prices for similar instruments are used to measure fair value, how these prices have been
adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the instrument subject to measurement; and
3) if a number of quotes for the same financial instrument have been obtained, then how fair value
has been determined using those quotes.

Fair value of the Financial intruments measured at amortised cost
The fair value of loans given is based on observable market transactions, to the extent available.
Wherever the observable market transactions are not available, fair value is estimated using valuation
models, such as discounted cash flow techniques. Input into the valuation techniques includes interest
rates, prepayment rates, primary origination or secondary market spreads. Input into the models may
include information obtained from other market participants, which includes observed primary and
secondary transactions.
To improve the accuracy of the valuation estimate for retail and smaller commercial loans, homogeneous
loans are grouped into portfolios with similar characteristics such as product.
The fair value of borrowings from banks is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques, applying
the rates that are offered for loans of similar maturities and terms.
T bills and Governemnt securities are valued based on market quotes.

of the Group’s market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within
acceptable risk tolerances levels to ensure the solvency and minimum volatility while optimising
the balance between profitability and managing associated risks.
Under Liquidity Risk Management (LRM) framework for the Group, ALCO sets up limits for each
significant type of risk/aggregated risk with liquidity being a primary factor in determining the level
of limits. The monitoring of risk limits defined as per ALM policy is done by ALCO on regular
basis. The Group has Asset Liability Management (ALM) support group prescribed by RBI which
meets on regular basis to ensure internal controls and reviews the liquidity risk management of the
group.
Interest rate risk:
Interest rate risk is measured through Interest rate sensitivity report where gaps are being monitored
classifying all rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities into various time period categories
according to earliest of contracted/behavioural maturities or anticipated re-pricing date. The Group
monitors interest rate risk through traditional gap and duration gap approaches on a monthly basis.

as per the relevant Ind AS. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge
relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an
economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group enters
into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the terms of
the hedged item, and so a qualitative and quantitative assessment of effectiveness is performed.

The Group has honoured all its debt obligations on time. Based on liquidity risk assessment,
cash-flows mismatches are within the stipulated regulatory limits. The Group has been
successful in maintaining the adequate liquidity by raising fresh/renewal of bank lines, regular
access to capital market and financial institution under the various schemes promulgated by
RBI to raise medium to long term funds. Owing to the above measures, the Group has not
seen a rise in its liquidity risk.
Refer Note No 45.B for the summary of Maturity analysis for Group’s financial liabilities and
financial assets as on 31st March 2024.
c) Operational Risk;
Operational Risk has been defined as “The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events “The risk of direct or indirect potential loss
arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group’s processes, personnel, systems, or
from external factors other than strategic and reputation risk Management of operational risk forms
an integral part of Group’s enterprise wide risk management systems. The organisation thrives
towards incremental improvements to its operational risk management framework to address
the dynamic industry landscape. Clear strategies and oversight by the Board of Directors and
senior management, a strong operational risk management culture, effective internal control and
reporting and contingency planning are crucial elements of Group’s operational risk management
framework.

(3) Assets obtained by taking possession of collateral:
The Group’s collection policy is to pursue timely realisation of the collateral in an orderly manner.
The Group upon a customer account becoming delinquent, undertakes the process to physically
repossess properties or other assets with the help of external agents to recover funds, to settle
outstanding. Any surplus funds if any received are returned to the customers/obligors. As a result of
this practice, the residential properties, vehicles, construction equipments and tractors under legal
repossession processes are not recorded on the balance sheet and not treated as non–current
assets held for sale. Asset in the form of real estate property, plant and machinery, shares and
securities received upon final settlement of the loan is recorded as non-current assets held for sale
Management monitors the market value of collateral as per the Credit monitoring process and will
request additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement as applicable.

Inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used for estimating ECL
1) Inputs:
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly
since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is
relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative
information and analysis based on the Group’s historical experience, expert credit assessment and
including forward looking information.
Total 907.84 1098.32
278NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a days past due, which is a
quantitative factor that indicates the risk of default. Additional factors such as customer fraud,
reschedulement of loans and directions by the risk management committee to exit certain risky
portfolios are also considered as qualitative factor. These factors are applied uniformly for each
lending. The determination of the credit risk is for each product, considering the unique risk and
rewards associated with it. The Group has observed varied level of risk across these stage and
buckets and a significant increase in risk in stage 2 and stage 3.
The objective of the ECL assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has
occurred for an exposure by comparing the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the
reporting date; with the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time
of initial recognition of the exposure and adjusted for changes on account of prepayments.
In assessing the impairment of loan assets under expected credit loss (ECL) Model, the loans have
been segmented into three stages based on the risk profiles. The three stages reflect the general
pattern of credit deterioration of a financial instrument.
Refer note 2(xiii) in Material accounting policies for definition of Stages of Asset
2) Assumptions:
The Group has applied following assumptions for determination of ECL.
1) “Loss given default” (LGD) is an estimate of loss from a transaction given that a default
occurs.
2) “Probability of default” (PD) is defined as the probability of whether the borrowers will default
on their obligations in the future. For assets which are in Stage 1, a 12-month PD is required.
For Stage 2 assets a lifetime PD is required while Stage 3 assets are considered to have a
100% PD.
3) “Exposure at default” (EAD) represents the expected exposure in the event of a default and
is the gross carrying amount in case of the financial assets held by the Group including loan
commitments.
4) Definition of default: A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails to make
the contractual payments within 90 days of when they fall due. Accordingly, the financial
assets shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the reporting date, it has been more than 90
days past due. Further if the customer has requested forbearance in repayment terms, such
restructured, rescheduled or renegotiated accounts are also classified as Stage 3. Non-
payment on another obligation of the same customer is also considered as a stage 3.
5) Forward looking information:
The Group incorporates forward looking information into both assessments of whether the
credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its
measurement of ECL. Based on the consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast
information, the Group forms a ‘base case’ view of the future direction of relevant economic
variables such as real GDP, domestic credit growth, money market interest rate etc. as well as
a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios. This process involves developing
two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of each
outcome. The base case represents a most likely outcome in a normal distribution curve
while the other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic outcomes. More
weight is applied to pessimistic outcome consistently as a matter of prudence than optimistic
outcome.
279Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
6) Assessment of significant increase in credit risk:
The credit risk on a financial asset of the Group are assumed to have increased significantly
since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.
Additionally, accounts identified and reviewed by the Executive committee for labelling
as breaching pre-defined critical credit risk parameters will also be classified as stage 2.
Accordingly, the financial assets shall be classified as Stage 2, based on the quantitative as
well as qualitative factors.
3) Estimation techniques:
The Group has applied the following estimation technique for ECL model:
1) The Group has used historic default rates for calculating the 12-month PD and Lifetime PDs
2) Loss given default is calculated after considering outstanding at the time of default and
adjusting for actual recoveries basis time value of money.
Credit risk monitoring techniques
Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may indicate that a significant increase in
credit risk has occurred on an exposure. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data
for Corporate and Retail exposures:
i) Overdue status
ii) Restructuring, reschedulement of loans and requests for granting of forbearance
iii) Fraudulent customer
iv) Exit directed by the Risk management committee
v) Accounts classified by SICR committee indicating significant increase in credit risk
vi) Information published in the Basel IRB (Basel internal rating based approach refers to set
of credit measurement techniques proposed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision
(BCBS) for determining capital adequacy of the bank) norms is also used Days past due are a
primary input for the determination of the PD for exposures. The Group collects performance
and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by product. For some
portfolios, information published in Basel IRB norms is also used.
The Group employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates
of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result
of the passage of time. Such statistical models are selected considering the availability of
information related to the probability of default for each product.
This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in
default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors. Key macro-economic indicators
includes but are not limited to Private consumption, Real GDP, Consumer prices, Long-term
bond yield, Unemployment Rate, Gross fixed investment rate etc.
For the purpose of determination of impact of forward looking information, the Group applies
various macro economic (ME) variables as stated above to each product and assess the
trend of the historical probability of defaults as compared to the forecasted probability of
default. Based on the directional trend of output, management applies an overlay if required.
Overtime, new ME variable may emerge to have a better correlation and may replace ME
being used now.
Based on advice from the external risk management experts, the Group considered variety of
external actual and forecast information to formulate a ‘base case’ view of the future direction
of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast
scenarios. Such forecasts are adjusted to estimate the PDs.
280NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on various
portfolios of financial assets have been developed based on analysing historical data over the
past 5 years.
A maximum of a 12-month PD or actual contractual tenure is considered for financial assets
for which credit risk has not significantly increased. The Group measures ECL for stage 2
and stage 3 assets considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period over
which it is exposed to credit risk.
The loans are segmented into homogenous product categories to determine the historical
PD/LGD as per similar risk profiles, this segmentation is subject to regular review
For portfolios in respect of which the Group has limited historical data, external benchmark
information is used to supplement the internally available data or internal benchmark with
similar credit risk profile.
vii) Techniques for determining LGD:
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD
parameters based on the history of recovery rates against defaulted counterparties. The
LGD models consider the cash flow received, assets received in lieu of settlement of loan
and collateral available for subsequent recovery that is integral to the financial asset. LGD
estimates are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the contractual interest rate
(approximation to expected EIR) as the discounting factor. Group has observed challenges
in the resolution of defaulted accounts with ageing more than two years and accordingly a
higher LGD estimate is applied assuming nil recoveries towards such accounts. The Group
has prospectively adopted collection curve method for computation of loss given defaults to
determine expected credit losses, in the Absence of observed history of default, LGD applied
is based on Basel IRB norms for certain products.
viii) Techniques for computation of EAD
a) EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Company
derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes
to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortisation. The EAD
of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount. For lending commitments, the EAD
includes the amount drawn, as well as potential future amounts that may be drawn
under the contract, which are estimated based on credit conversion factor for various
loan commitments. For financial assets in stage 2, EAD is determined by estimating
the possible exposure in future using linear amortisation techniques.
b) When estimating ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the company estimates the
expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life.
ECL is the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are
due to the Company if the holder of the commitment draws down the loan and the cash
flows that the Company expects to receive if the loan is drawn down.
ix) Modified financial assets
The Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as forbearance
activities, restructuring or rescheduling) to maximise collection opportunities and minimise
the risk of default. Under the Companies forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted
on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of
default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original
contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest
payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are
subject to the forbearance policy. The Risk Management Committee regularly reviews reports
on forbearance activities.
281Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Upon renegotiation, such accounts are classified as stage 3. Such accounts are upgraded
to stage 1 only upon observation of satisfactory repayments for at least one year from the
commencement of the first payment of interest or principal (whichever is later).
Pursuant to RBI Covid restructuring policy, accounts for which Covid restructuring facility
were given have been reclassified from Stage I to Stage II if DPD at invocation was between
0-30 and If the DPD was 30+ then the accounts were further downgraded within Stage II and
corresponding staging wise ECL provision was done.

Modified financial assets
The Group renegotiates loans given to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as forbearance
activities, restructuring or rescheduling) to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of
default. Under the Group’s forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the
customer is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the
customer made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the customer is
expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and
amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance
policy. The Risk Management Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.
Upon renegotiation, such accounts are classified as stage 3. Such accounts are upgraded to stage 1
only upon observation of satisfactory repayments of one year from the date of such down-gradation and
accordingly loss allowance is measured using 12 month PD.

Limited (“TCCL”) with the Company, which became effective on January 1, 2024 and was accounted
as a common control business combination in accordance with Appendix C of Ind AS 103 - “Business
Combinations” from the appointed date i.e. April 1, 2023. Further, the corresponding previous year
figures included in the Standalone financial statements have been restated by the Management to
include the audited figures of TCFSL and TCCL. The financial statements for TCFSL and TCCL were
audited by then respective statutory auditors, whose reports dated April 25, 2023 and April 20, 2023,
respectively expressed an unmodified opinion on those financial statements.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
5. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. These matters
were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
300Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
Allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Loan Assets:
Total Loans as at March 31, 2024: 1,09,265.43 crores
ECL Provision as at March 31, 2024: 2,632.61 crores
(Refer Note 36 to the Standalone financial statements)
Indian Accounting Standard 109 - Financial
Instruments (‘Ind AS 109’) requires the Company to
provide for impairment of its financial assets using
the expected credit loss (‘ECL’) approach involving
an estimation of probability of loss on such financial
assets, considering reasonable and supportable
information about past events, current conditions
and forecasts of future economic conditions which
could impact the credit quality of the Company’s
financial assets. The estimation of impairment
loss allowance on loan assets involves significant
judgement and estimates, which are subject to
uncertainty, and involves applying appropriate
measurement principles in case of loss events.
The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is calculated using
the percentage of probability of default (PD), loss
given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD)
for each of the stages of loan portfolio. Significant
management judgment and assumptions involved
in measuring ECL is required with respect to:
•
Segmentation of loan book in buckets based on
common risk characteristics;
• Staging of loans and in particular determining
the criteria, which includes qualitative factors for
identifying a significant increase in credit risk (i.e.
Stage 2) and credit-impaired (i.e. Stage - 3);
•
factoring in future macro-economic and industry
specific estimates and forecasts;
•
past experience and forecast data on customer
behaviour on repayments;
•
varied statistical modelling techniques to
determine probability of default, loss given
default and exposure at default basis, the default
history of loans, subsequent recoveries made
and other relevant factors using probability-
weighted scenarios.
Our audit procedures in respect of this area
included, but not limited to:
a. Obtained and read Companies policies on
ECL and evaluated the appropriateness of the
Company’s accounting policies for impairment of
financial instruments and assessed compliance
of the same with Indian Accounting Standard
109-Financial Instruments (‘Ind AS 109’) and
ensured such policy is in compliant with the
requirements of the RBI circulars / guidelines;
b. Obtained the policy on moratorium and
restructuring of loans approved by the Board of
Directors pursuant to the RBI circulars/guidelines;
c. Performed a walkthrough of the impairment loss
allowance process, and assessed the design and
tested operating effectiveness of the key controls
over completeness and accuracy of the key
inputs (including loan book as at March 31, 2024)
and assumptions considered for calculation,
recording and monitoring of the impairment loss
recognized. These controls, amongst others,
included controls over the allocation of assets into
stages along with passing of journal entries and
preparing disclosures;
d. Obtained an understanding of the modelling
techniques adopted by the Company including
the key inputs and assumptions. Since, modelling
assumptions and parameters were based on
historical data, we assessed whether historical
experience was representative of current
circumstances and was relevant in view of the
recent impairment losses incurred within the
portfolios;
e. Assessed the assumptions used by the Company
for grouping and staging of loan portfolio into
various categories and default buckets and their
appropriateness for determining the probability-
weighted default (PD) and loss-given default
(LGD) rates;
301Annual Report 2023-24
Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
Considering the significance of the above matter
to the financial statements and since the matter
required significant attention to test the calculation
of expected credit losses, we identified this as a key
audit matter for current year audit.
f. Performed sample testing of the input data used
for determining the PD (probability of default) and
LGD (loss given default) rates and agreed the
data with the underlying books of accounts and
records;
g. Tested the arithmetical accuracy of computation
of ECL (expected credit loss) provision performed
by the Company;
h. Tested the completeness of loans included in
the ECL calculations as of March 31, 2024 by
reconciling such data with the balances as per
loan book register; and
i. Assessed and validated the adequacy and
appropriateness of the disclosures made by the
management as per the requirements of Ind AS
109 -’Financial Instruments’ in the Standalone
Financial Statements.
Information Technology (“IT”) System and Controls
The Company is dependent on its information
technology (‘IT’) systems due to the significant
number of transactions that are processed daily
across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also,
IT application controls are critical to ensure that
changes to applications and underlying data are
made in an appropriate manner and under controlled
environment. Appropriate controls contribute to
mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as
a result of changes to applications and data. On
account of the pervasive use of IT systems across
varied different phases of business, the testing
with respect to general computer controls of the IT
systems used in financial reporting was identified to
be a key audit matter.
The Company has a complex IT architecture to
support its day-to-day business operations. High
volume of transactions is processed and recorded
on single or multiple applications. The reliability
and security of IT systems plays a key role in the
business operations of the Company. Since large
volume of transactions are processed daily, IT
controls are required to ensure that applications
process data as expected and that changes are
made in an appropriate manner.
Appropriate IT general controls and application
controls are required to ensure that such IT
systems are able to process the data, as required,
completely, accurately and consistently for reliable
financial reporting.
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included,
but not limited to:
a. Involved IT specialists as part of the audit for
the purpose of testing the IT general controls
and application controls (automated and semi-
automated controls) to determine the accuracy
of the information produced by the Company’s IT
systems.
b. Obtained an understanding of the Company’s
IT applications, databases and operating
systems relevant to financial reporting and the
control environment, including an understanding
of the process, mapping of applications and
understanding financial risks posed by people-
process and technology.
c. Tested design and operating effectiveness of
key controls over user access management
(including user access provisioning,
de-provisioning, user access review, password
configuration review and privilege access),
change management (including compliance of
change release in production environment to
the defined procedures), program development
(including review of data migration activity),
computer operations (including testing of key
controls pertaining to, backup, batch processing,
incident management and data centre security).
302Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company’s key financial accounting and
reporting processes are highly dependent on
information systems including automated controls in
systems, such that there exists a risk that gaps in the
IT control environment could result in the financial
accounting and reporting records being materially
misstated. The Company uses several systems for
its overall financial reporting. In addition to it, large
transaction volumes and the increasing challenges
to protect the integrity of the Company’s systems
and data, we have identified ‘IT systems and
automated controls’ as key audit matter because
of the high-level automation, significant number of
systems being used by the management and the
complexity of the IT architecture and its impact on
the financial reporting system.
d. Performed procedures for a selected group of
key controls over financial and reporting system
to determine that these controls remained
unchanged during the year or were changed
following the standard change management
process.
e. Tested key automated and manual business cycle
controls including testing of alternate procedures
to assess whether there were any unaddressed
IT risks that would materially impact the financial
statements.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
6. 7. 8. The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the Standalone financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The other information is expected to be made available to
us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the Standalone financial statement does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
9. When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we
are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s
responsibilities Relating to Other Information’.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial
Statement
10. The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act
with respect to the preparation of these Standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view
of the financial position, financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting
Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with Rules, as amended. This responsibility
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial
Statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
303Annual Report 2023-24
11. In preparing the Standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
12. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
13. 14. 15. 16. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these Standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
14.1
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.
14.2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we
are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating
effectiveness of such controls.
14.3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management and Board of Directors.
14.4 Conclude on the appropriateness of management and Board of Director’s use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
Standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going
concern.
14.5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.
30417. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters
that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone financial statements for the year ended
March 31, 2024 and are therefore, the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

the current joint auditor whose report dated April 27, 2023 expressed an unmodified opinion.

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of Tata

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining
internal financial controls based on the internal control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the

detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference
to Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section

audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
315Annual Report 2023-24
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone
Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are
subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
Tata Capital Limited (CIN : U65990MH1991PLC060670) (the “Company” or “TCL”) is a subsidiary of Tata
Sons Private Limited.
2. Basis of Preparation and material accounting policies
i. Statement of compliance:
These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting
Standards (Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended
by the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2016), notified under Section 133 of the
Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) (as amended), other relevant provisions of the Act, guidelines
issued by the Reserve Bank of India as applicable to NBFCs and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India. Any application guidance / clarifications / directions issued by RBI or
other regulators are implemented as and when they are issued / applicable, the guidance notes/
announcements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) are also applied
except where compliance with other statutory promulgations require a different treatment. Material
accounting policy information has been consistently applied except where a newly issued Ind AS
is initially adopted or a revision to an existing Ind AS required a change in the material accounting
policy information hitherto in use. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board
of Directors (BOD) on May 10, 2024.
ii. Presentation of financial statements:
The Balance Sheet, Statement of Profit and Loss and Statement of Changes in Equity are prepared
and presented in the format prescribed in the Division III of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013
(the ‘Act’). The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements
of Ind AS.
A summary of the material accounting policy information and other explanatory information is in
accordance with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) as
specified under Section 133 of the Act including applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)
and accounting principles generally accepted in India.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. They are
only offset and reported net when, in addition to having an unconditional legally enforceable right to
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event, the parties also intend to
settle on a net basis.
Amounts in the financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees in Crore, which is also the
Company’s functional currency and all amounts have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs unless
otherwise indicated.
iii. Basis of measurement:
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period as explained in the
material accounting policy information below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods
and services at the time of entering into the transaction.
iv. Measurement of fair values:
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether
that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
326NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics
of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when
pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
A number of the Company’s material accounting policy information and disclosures require the
measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes for certain items in these financial statements
is determined considering the following measurement methods:
Items Measurement basis
Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivatives instruments)
Net defined benefit (asset)/liability Fair value
v. Fair value of planned assets less present value of
defined benefit obligations
Property plant and equipment Value in use under Ind AS 36
Fair values are categorized into different levels (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3) in a fair value hierarchy
based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. When measuring the fair value of an asset
or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to
measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then
the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy
as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The levels are described as follows:
a. b. c. Level 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that the Company can access at the measurement date
Level 2: inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the valuation of assets or liabilities that the Company
can access at the measurement date.
Valuation model and framework used for fair value measurement and disclosure of financial
instrument
Refer notes 34A and 34B
The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the
reporting period during which the change has occurred
Use of estimates and judgements:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management of the
Company to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported balances of
assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of income and expenses for the reporting period. The application
of material accounting policy information that require critical accounting estimates involving complex
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in the financial statements have been disclosed
as applicable in the respective notes to accounts. Accounting estimates could change from period
to period. Future results could differ from these estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are
made as the Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are
made and, if material, their effect are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
327Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Judgements:
Information about judgements made in applying material accounting policy information that have
most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements is included in the
following note:
-
Note xi - classification of financial assets: assessment of the business model within which the
assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Assumptions and estimation of uncertainties:
Information about assumptions and estimation of uncertainties that have a significant risk
of resulting in a material adjustment in the year ending March 31, 2024 are included in the
following notes:
-
Note xii - impairment test of non-financial assets: key assumption underlying recoverable
amounts.
-
Note xi - The Company’s EIR methodology: rate of return that represents the best estimate of a
constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given/taken.
-
Note xii - useful life of property, plant, equipment and intangibles.
-
Note 42 - Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes,
including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions
-
Note xxi - recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions
about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources.
-
Note xiv - measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions.
-
Note 34 - determination of the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable
inputs.
-
Note 36A(iii) - impairment of financial instruments: assessment of whether credit risk on
the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, assumptions used in
estimating recoverable cash flows and incorporation of forward-looking information in the
measurement of expected credit loss (ECL). The weights assigned to different scenarios for
measurement of forward looking ECL, (i.e. best case, worst case and base case) also requires
judgement.
vi. Interest:
Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the
principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and
costs, as well as a profit margin.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate (EIR) is
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial
instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.
Calculation of the EIR includes all fees received that are incremental and directly attributable to the
acquisition of a financial asset.
Interest income is calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of non-credit
impaired financial assets (i.e. at the amortised cost of the financial asset before adjusting for
any expected credit loss allowance). For credit-impaired financial assets the interest income is
calculated by applying the EIR to the amortised cost of the credit-impaired financial assets {i.e. at the
amortised cost of the financial asset after adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance (ECLs)}.
The Company assesses the collectability of the interest on credit impaired assets at each reporting
328NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
vii. date. Based on the outcome of such assessment, the interest income accrued on credit impaired
financial assets are either accounted for as income or written off as per the write off policy of the
Company.
The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured on
initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using
the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount
and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.
The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before
adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.
Fee and Commission income not integral to effective interest rate (EIR) method under Ind AS
109 and Income from services and distribution of financial products:
The Company recognises the fee and commission income not integral to EIR under Ind AS 109 in
accordance with the terms of the relevant customer contracts / agreements and when it is probable
that the Company will collect the consideration for following:
Revenue in the form of income from financial advisory (other than for those items to which Ind AS
109 - Financial Instruments are applicable) is measured at the transaction price allocated to the
performance obligation, in accordance with Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with customers.
The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers (other than financial assets to
which Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instruments’ is applicable) based on a five step model as set out in Ind
AS 115 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’.
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two
or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every
contract that must be met.
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a
contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to
which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services
to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract
that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to
each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Fees and commission income
1. The Company recognises service and administration charges towards rendering of additional
services to its loan customers on satisfactory completion of service delivery. Bounce charges
levied on customers for non-payment of instalment on the contractual date is recognised on
realisation.
2. 3. 4. 5. Fees on value added services and products are recognised on rendering of services and
products to the customer.
Distribution income is earned by distribution of services and products of other entities under
distribution arrangements. The income so earned is recognised on successful distribution on
behalf of other entities subject to there being no significant uncertainty of its recovery.
Foreclosure charges are collected from loan customers for early payment / closure of loan and
are recognised on realisation.
Advisory Fees are charged to offshore investment manager for providing non-exclusive non
binding support services for transactions by private equity funds. Income from advisory services

heads, provided there is reasonable certainty of its ultimate realization.
8. Wealth Management Business:
a) Brokerage / Distribution Fee Income
Bonds / Fixed Deposits / Unlisted Equity / Wills & Trust / Alternative Investment
Funds / International products / External Asset Cross sell / Other Referral Products
Income is recognised as per the contractual rate on trade date basis and is exclusive of
goods and services tax and securities transaction tax (STT) wherever applicable.
b) Insurance Income
Income is recognised for the commission earned by the Company on the issuance of
policies logged in during the month and confirmed by the Insurers subject to cancellations
done by the customers.
c) Income from Mutual Funds
Income is recognised as per the commission specified in the agreement on daily average
assets under management which is provided by Registrar and Transfer Agents of each
Mutual Fund Entities
d) Income from Portfolio Management Services (“PMS”) & Alternative Investment
Funds (“Trail based AIF”)
a. Income from PMS and Trail based AIF is recognised on monthly basis on the monthly
closing assets of each partner and as per the contractual commission specified in the
agreement.
b. c. Processing fees, if any, is recognized on upfront basis in the year of receipt.
Performance based fee, wherever applicable, is recognized as a percentage of annual
profit, in accordance with the terms of the agreement with clients on the completion of
the period.
viii. Dividend income
Income from dividend on investment in equity shares and preference share of corporate bodies and
units of mutual funds is accounted when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established and it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount
of the dividend can be measured reliably. Dividend income on financial assets measured at fair value
through profit and loss is presented under Dividend income and not as a part of Net gains/(losses) on
fair value changes.
ix. Leases
Asset given on lease:
Leases are classified as operating lease where significant portion of risks and reward of ownership of
assets acquired under lease is retained by the lessor. Leases of assets under which substantially all of
the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessee are classified as finance lease.
330NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Assets given under finance lease are recognised as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment
in the lease. Lease rentals are apportioned between principal and interest on the internal rate of return.
The principal amount received reduces the net investment in the lease and interest is recognised as
revenue.
Lease rental - under operating leases (excluding amount for services such as insurance and maintenance)
are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Asset taken on lease:
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for properties.
The Company presents right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately on the face of the Balance
sheet. Lease payments (including interest) have been classified as financing cashflows.
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial
measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement
date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to
be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying
asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less
any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any, and adjusted for certain re-
measurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method
from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment
whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if
any, is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. When a right-of-use asset meets the definition of
investment property, it is presented in investment property.
The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid
at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the
Company uses incremental borrowing rate.
The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by
lease payment made. The carrying amount of lease liability is remeasured to reflect any reassessment
or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. A change in the estimate
of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in
the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a
termination option is reasonably certain not be exercised.
The Company has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it
is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain
to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities
and right of use assets recognised. The discounted rate is generally based on incremental borrowing
rate specific to the lease being evaluated.
x. Borrowing cost:
Borrowing costs include interest expense calculated using the EIR on respective financial instruments
measured at amortised cost and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings, to the
extent they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
The effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the
expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial liability.
Calculation of the EIR includes all fees paid that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of
a financial liability.

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
xi. Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet on trade date,
i.e. when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs and
revenues that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities
(other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on
initial recognition. Transaction costs and revenues of financial assets or financial liabilities carried at fair
value through the profit or loss account are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
Trade Receivables are measured at transaction price.
a) Financial assets
Classification
On initial recognition, depending on the Company’s business model for managing the financial
assets and its contractual cash flow characteristics, a financial asset is classified as measured at;
1) amortised cost;
2) 3) fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); or
fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period
the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not recognised as at FVTPL:
-
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and
-
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably
elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI (designated as FVTOCI –
equity investment). This election is made an investment – by – investment basis.
All financials assets not classified and measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI as described above are
measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate the financials assets
that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI or at FVTPL, if
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces the accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Business model assessment
The Company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset
is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is
provided to management. The information considered includes:
-
the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.
-
how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company’s management;
-
the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that
business model) and how those risks are managed;
-
the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such
sales and expectation about future sales activity.
332NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-
How managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether the compensation is based on the
fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).
At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Company determines whether newly recognized financial
assets are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect a new business model. The Company
reassess its business models each reporting period to determine whether the business models have
changed since the preceding period.
Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on
initial recognition. That principal amount may change over the life of the financial assets (e.g. if there
are payments of principal). Amount of ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money
and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time
and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit
margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the
Company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the
financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash
flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Company considers:
-
Contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
-
Terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features;
-
Prepayment and extension features; and
-
Terms that limit the Company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets.
Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Contractual terms
that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic
lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise
to contractual cash flows that are SPPI.
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the
contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual
par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents
the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include
reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if
the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.
333Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and
losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss. The transaction costs and fees are also
recorded related to these instruments in the statement of profit and
loss.
Financial assets at amortised
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
cost
the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by
impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and
losses and impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or
loss. Any gain or loss on de-recognition is recognised in the statement
of profit or loss.
Financial assets (other
than Equity Investments) at
FVTOCI
Financial assets that are held within a business model whose
objective is achieved by both, selling financial assets and collecting
contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest, are subsequently measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income. Fair value movements are recognized in the
other comprehensive income (OCI). Interest income measured using
the EIR method and impairment losses, if any are recognised in the
statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition, cumulative gain or
loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the
statement of Profit and Loss.
Equity investments at FVTOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends
are recognised as income in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless
the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the
investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are
not reclassified to profit or loss.
Reclassifications within classes of financial assets
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the
Company changes its business model for managing financial assets.
The classification and measurement requirements of the new category apply prospectively from the first
day of the first reporting period following the change in business model that result in reclassifying the
Company’s financial assets.
Impairment of Financial Asset
Impairment approach
Overview of the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) principles
The Company records allowance for expected credit losses for all loans (including those classified
as measured at FVTOCI), together with loan commitments, in this section all referred to as ‘financial
instruments’ other than those measured at FVTPL. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment
under Ind AS 109.
The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime
expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since
origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12m ECL).
The Company’s policies for determining if there has been a significant increase in credit risk are set out
in Note 36A.
The 12m ECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a
financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.
334NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Both LTECLs and 12m ECLs are calculated on an individual/portfolio basis – having similar risk
characteristic, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments.
The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period,
of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by
considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.
Based on the above process, the Company categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, as
described below:
Stage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Company recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs.
This also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from
Stage 2.
Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company
records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has
improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails
to make the contractual payments within 90 days of when they fall due. Accordingly, the financial assets
shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the reporting date, it has been 90 days past due. Further if the
customer has requested forbearance in repayment terms, such restructured, rescheduled or renegotiated
accounts are also classified as Stage 3. Non-payment on another obligation of the same customer is
also considered as a stage 3. Defaulted accounts include customers reported as fraud in the Fraud Risk
Management Committee. Once an account defaults as a result of the Days past due condition, it will be
considered to be cured only when entire arrears of interest and principal are paid by the borrower. The
Company records an allowance for the LTECLs.
Undrawn loan commitments
Undrawn loan commitments are commitments under which, over the duration of the commitment,
the Company is required to provide a loan with pre-specified terms to the customer. Undrawn loan
commitments are in the scope of the ECL requirements.
Financial guarantee contract:
A financial guarantee contract requires the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the
holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance
with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are initially measured at their fair values and, if not
designated as at FVTPL and not arising from a transfer of a financial asset, are subsequently measured
at the higher of:
• the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance with Ind AS 109; and
• the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognised
in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policies. The Company has not designated
any financial guarantee contracts as FVTPL.
Company’s ECL for financial guarantee is estimated based on the present value of the expected
payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The shortfalls are discounted by the
interest rate relevant to the exposure.
The Measurement of ECLs
The Company calculates ECLs based on a probability-weighted scenario to measure the expected cash
shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash
flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects
to receive.
335Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:
Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a
given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility
has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio.
Exposure at Default (EAD): The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date,
taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of
principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed
facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.
Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a
default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and
those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually
expressed as a percentage of the EAD.
Impairment losses and releases are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or
gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value
When estimating LTECLs for undrawn loan commitments, the Company estimates the expected portion
of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the
present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn down, based on a probability-
weightage. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the
loan.
The above calculated PDs, EAD and LGDs are reviewed and changes in the forward looking estimates
are analysed during the year.
The mechanics of the ECL method are summarised below:
Stage 1 The 12 months ECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result
from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting
date. These expected 12-months default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the
expected LGD.
Stage 2 When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company
records an allowance for the LTECLs. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, but PDs and
LGDs are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by
an contractual or portfolio EIR as the case may be.
Stage 3 For loans considered credit-impaired, the Company recognises the lifetime expected credit
losses for these loans. The method is similar to that for stage 2 assets, with the PD set at 100%.
In ECL model the Company relies on broad range of forward looking information for economic inputs.
The Company recognises loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) on all financial assets at
amortised cost that are debt instruments, - debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive
income, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. No impairment loss is recognised on
equity investments.
When determining whether credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Company considers reasonable and
supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, including on historical experience and forward-
looking information (Refer Note 36A(iii)).
Impairment of Trade receivable and Operating lease receivable
Impairment allowance on trade receivables is made under simplified approach on the basis of life time
credit loss method, in addition to specific provision considering the uncertainty of recoverability of certain
receivables.
336NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Write-off
Impaired loans and receivables are written off, against the related allowance for loan impairment on
completion of the Company’s internal processes and when the Company concludes that there is no
longer any realistic prospect of recovery of part or all of the loan. For loans that are individually assessed
for impairment, the timing of write off is determined on a case by case basis. A write-off constitutes a de-
recognition event. The Company has a right to apply enforcement activities to recover such written off
financial assets. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the statement
of profit and loss.
Collateral valuation and repossession
To mitigate the credit risk on financial assets, the Company seeks to use collateral, where possible
as per the powers conferred on the Non Banking Finance Companies under the Securitisation and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (“SARFAESI”).
The Company provides fully secured, partially secured and unsecured loans to individuals and Corporates.
In its normal course of business upon account becoming delinquent, the Company physically repossess
properties or other assets in its retail portfolio. Any surplus funds are returned to the customers/
obligors. As a result of this practice, the residential properties, vehicles, plant and machinery under legal
repossession processes are not recorded on the balance sheet and not treated as non–current assets
held for sale unless the title is also transferred in the name of the Company.

Modification and De-recognition of financial assets
Modification of financial assets
A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of a
financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between initial recognition and maturity of the
financial asset. A modification affects the amount and/or timing of the contractual cash flows either
immediately or at a future date. The Company renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulty
to maximise collection and minimise the risk of default. A loan forbearance is granted in cases where
although the borrower made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms, there is a
high risk of default or default has already happened and the borrower is expected to be able to meet the
revised terms. The revised terms in most of the cases include an extension of the maturity of the loan,
changes to the timing of the cash flows of the loan (principal and interest repayment), reduction in the
amount of cash flows due (principal and interest forgiveness). Such accounts are classified as stage 3
immediately upon such modification in the terms of the contract.
Not all changes in terms of loans are considered as renegotiation and changes in terms of a class of
obligors that are not overdue is not considered as renegotiation and is not subjected to deterioration in
staging.
337Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is derecognised when:
1) 2) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or the Company has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, but has transferred control of the
asset
If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial
asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised
borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the
carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain
or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at
FVTOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred
financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a
separate asset or liability.
Securitization and Assignment
In case of transfer of loans through securitisation and direct assignment transactions, the transferred
loans are de-recognised and gains/losses are accounted for, only if the Company transfers substantially
all risks and rewards specified in the underlying assigned loan contract.
In accordance with the Ind AS 109, on de-recognition of a financial asset under assigned transactions, the
difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received are recognised in the Statement
of Profit and Loss.
Financial liability and Equity
Debt and equity instruments that are issued are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at the amortised cost using the effective interest method,
unless at initial recognition, they are classified as fair value through profit and loss. Interest expense are
recognised in the Statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in
the statement of profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange
financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable
to the Company or a contract that will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments and is
a non-derivative contract for which the Company is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of its
own equity instruments, or a derivative contract over own equity that will or may be settled other than by
the exchange of a fixed amount of cash (or another financial asset) for a fixed number of the Company’s
own equity instruments.
338NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Classification
The Company classifies its financial liability as “Financial liability measured at amortised cost” except for
those classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
Equity
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. A conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed
amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments
is an equity instrument.
No gain/loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s
own equity instruments.
b) Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk
exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if
certain criteria are met.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and
are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain/loss is
recognised in the statement of profit and loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and is
effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the statement of profit
and loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash
flows associated with its floating rate borrowings arising from changes in interest rates and exchange
rates.
At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Company documents the risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Company also documents the economic relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of
the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.
Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in
the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other equity under ‘effective
portion of cash flows hedges’. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is
recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a
present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the
derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Company designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts
as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedge relationships. The change in fair value of the forward
element of the forward exchange contracts (‘forward points’) is separately accounted for as cost of
hedging and recognised separately within equity.
If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires,
is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedged future
cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other
equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

c) Cash, Cash equivalents and bank balances
Cash, Cash equivalents and bank balances include fixed deposits,margin money deposits, and
earmarked balances with banks are carried at amortised cost.
xii. Property, plant and equipment(PPE)
a) PPE
PPE acquired by the Company are reported at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Estimated cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring
the site on which its located does not arise for owned assets, for leased assets the same are borne by
the lessee as per the lease agreement. The acquisition cost includes any cost attributable for bringing an
asset to its working condition net of tax/duty credits availed, which comprises of purchase consideration
and other directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to their working condition for their intended
use. PPE is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will
flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on
PPE after its purchase is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the
enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
b) Capital work-in-progress
PPE not ready for the intended use on the date of the Balance Sheet are disclosed as “capital work-
in-progress” and carried at cost, comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses and attributable
interest.
c) Other Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable
to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible
assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortisation
and cumulative impairment. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically
attributable to the acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and capitalised as a part of the cost of
the intangible assets. Expenses on software support and maintenance are charged to the Statement of
Profit and Loss during the year in which such costs are incurred.
d) Intangible assets under development
Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Intangible
assets under development”.
e) Depreciation and Amortisation
Depreciable amount for tangible property, plant and equipment is the cost of an asset, or other amount
substituted for cost, less its estimated residual value. The residual value of each asset given on Operating
lease is determined at the time of recording of the lease asset. If the residual value of the Operating
lease asset is higher than 5%, the Company has a justification in place for considering the same.
Depreciation on tangible property, plant and equipment deployed for own use has been provided on the
straight-line method as per the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except in
respect of buildings, computer equipment, software, plant and machinery and vehicles, in whose case
the life of the assets has been internally assessed based on the nature of the asset, the estimated usage
of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, etc.
Based on internal assessment, depreciation on tangible property, plant and equipment deployed on
operating lease has been provided on the straight-line method over the primary lease period of the
asset. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each financial year end with
the effect of any change in the estimates of useful life/residual value is accounted on prospective basis.
Depreciation for additions to/deductions from owned assets is calculated pro rata to the remaining period
of use. Depreciation charge for impaired assets is adjusted in future periods in such a manner that the

revised carrying amount of the asset is allocated over its remaining useful life. All capital assets with
individual value less than ` 5,000 are depreciated fully in the year in which they are purchased.
Purchased software / licenses are amortised over the estimated useful life during which the benefits
are expected to accrue.The method of amortisation and useful life are reviewed at the end of each
accounting year with the effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective
basis. Amortisation on impaired assets is provided by adjusting the amortisation charge in the remaining
periods so as to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount over its remaining useful life.
Estimated useful life considered by the Company are:
Asset Estimated Useful Life
Leasehold Improvements As per lease period
Furniture and Fixtures Owned: 10 years
Computer Equipment Owned: 4 years
Office Equipment Owned: 5 years
Vehicles Owned: 4 years
Software Owned: 1 to 15 years
Buildings / Investmentr Property 25 years
Plant & Machinery Owned: 10 years
In case of leased assets, useful life is considered as per the lease period.\
f) Investment property
Properties held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as Investment properties and
measured and reported at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition its measured
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. When the use of an
existing property changes from owner-occupied to investment property, the property is reclassified as
investment property at its carrying amount on the date of reclassification.
When there is a change in use of an existing property classified as investment property evidenced by
commencement of owner occupation, the property is reclassified as property, plant & equipment at its
carrying amount on the date of reclassification.
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss
arising on de-recognition of property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same
period.
g) Impairment of assets:
Upon an observed trigger the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its PPE, investment property
and intangible asset to determine whether there is any indication that the asset have suffered an
impairment loss. If such indication exists, the PPE, investment property and intangible assets are tested
for impairment so as to determine the impairment loss, if any.
Impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset
for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, such deficit is
recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss as impairment loss and the carrying amount
of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
341Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss is recognised for the asset
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and
Loss.
h) De-recognition of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal
or retirement of an item of PPE is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. An intangible asset
is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal.
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in the Statement of Profit
and Loss.
xiii. Non-Current Assets held for sale:
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered
principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset is available for immediate
sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such asset and
the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year
from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell.
The Company has a policy to make impairment provision at one third of the value of the Asset for
each year upon completion of three years up to the end of five years based on the past observed
pattern of recoveries. Losses on initial classification as Held for sale and subsequent gains & losses
on remeasurement are recognised in Statement of Profit and loss. Once classified as Held for sale, the
assets are no longer amortised or depreciated.
xiv. Employee Benefits
Defined Contribution benefits include superannuation fund .
Defined Employee benefits include gratuity fund, provident fund compensated absences and long
service awards.
Defined contribution plans
The Company’s contribution to superannuation fund is considered as defined contribution plan and is
charged as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss based on the amount of contribution required
to be made and when services are rendered by the employees.
Defined benefit plans
The Company makes Provident Fund contributions, a defined benefit plan for qualifying employees.
Under the Schemes, both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a specified
percentage of the covered employees’ salary (currently 12% of employees’ salary). The contributions,
except that the employer’s contribution towards pension fund is paid to the Regional Provident Fund
office, as specified under the law, are made to the provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by Tata
Capital Limited (“the ultimate parent Company”). The interest rate payable to the members of the trust
shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government under the
Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall on account of , if any,
shall be made good by the Company. Hence the Company is liable for annual contributions and any
deficiency in interest cost compared to interest computed based on the rate of interest declared by the
342NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Central Government. The total liability in respect of the interest shortfall of the Fund is determined on the
basis of an actuarial valuation. The interest liability arising only to the extent of the aforesaid differential
shortfalls is a defined benefit plan. There is no such shortfall as at March 31, 2024.
For defined benefit plans in the form of gratuity, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the
Projected Unit Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each Balance Sheet date. As
per Ind AS 19, the service cost and the net interest cost are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent
that the benefits are already vested. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service
cost, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited
to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to
the schemes.
Short-term employee benefits
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the
services rendered by employees are recognised during the year when the employees render the service.
These benefits include performance incentive and compensated absences which are expected to occur
within twelve months after the end of the reporting period in which the employee renders the related
service.
The cost of short-term compensated absences is accounted as under:
(a) in case of accumulated compensated absences, when employees render the services that increase
their entitlement of future compensated absences; and
(b) in case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur.
Other long-term employee benefits
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the year
in which the employee renders the related service are recognised as a liability at the present value of the
defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets out of which
the obligations are expected to be settled. Long term service awards are recognised as a liability at the
present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date.
The obligation is measured on the basis of actuarial valuation using Projected unit credit method and
remeasurements gains/ losses are recognised in P&L in the period in which they arise.
Share based payment transaction
The stock options of the Parent Company, granted to employees pursuant to the Company’s Stock
Options Schemes, are measured at the fair value of the options at the grant date as per Black and Scholes
model. The fair value of the options is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation
cost, with a corresponding increase in other equity, over the vesting period on a straight line basis. The
amount recognised as expense in each year is arrived at based on the number of grants expected to
vest. If a grant lapses after the vesting period, the cumulative discount recognised as expense, with a
corresponding increase in other equity, in respect of such grant is transferred to the General reserve
within other equity.
xv. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency are recorded on initial recognition
using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign currency monetary
items are reported at the rates prevailing at the year end. Non-monetary items that are measured in
terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
343Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Functional currency of the Company and foreign operations has been determined based on the primary
economic environment in which the Company and its foreign operations operate considering the currency
in which funds are generated, spent and retained.
Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items at
each Balance Sheet date at the closing spot rate are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in
the period in which they arise.
xvi. Operating Segments
The Company’s main business is financing by way of loans for retail and corporate borrowers in India.
The Company’s operating segments consist of “Financing Activity”, “ Investment Activity” and “Others”.

– operating segments reporting are considered to constitute reportable segment. The Chief Operating
Decision Maker (CODM) of the Company is the Managing Director along with the Board of Directors in
the operating segment. Operating segment disclosures are consistent with the information reviewed by
the CODM.
An operating segment is a component of the company that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions
with any of the company’s other components, and for which discrete financial information is available.

financing, credit substitutes, investments linked to/arising out of lending business and bill discounting.
The “Investment Activity” segment includes corporate investments including private equity investments
and “Others” segment primarily includes advisory services, wealth management, distribution of financial
products and leasing.
Revenue and expense directly attributable to segments are reported under each operating segment.
Expenses not directly identifiable to each of the segments have been allocated to each segment on the
basis of associated revenues/expense of each segment. All other revenue and expenses which are not
attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as un-allocable expenses.
Assets and liabilities that are directly attributable to segments are disclosed under each reportable
segment. All other assets and liabilities are disclosed as un-allocable.
xvii. Investments in associates
The Company has elected to measure investment in associate at cost as per Ind AS 27 – Separate
Financial Statements, accordingly measurement at fair value through statement of profit and loss account
and related disclosure under Ind AS 109 does not apply.
xviii. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity
holders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid up equity
share is included as fully paid equivalent according to the fraction paid up.
Diluted earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares and
dilutive potential shares, except where the result would be anti-dilutive
xix. Taxation
Income Tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognized in the
Statement of Profit and Loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity when they relate to items
that are recognized in the respective line items.
344NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Current Tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the
year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of
current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering
the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax law) enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the
recognised amounts and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or
simultaneously.
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized
business loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary
differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/
reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will
be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
xx. Goods and Services Input Tax Credit
Goods and Services Input tax credit is accounted for in the books in the period in which the supply of
goods or service received is accounted and when there is no uncertainty in availing/utilising the credits.
xxi. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the Company determines the level of provision
by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the
liability. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any
reimbursement.
Contingent assets/liabilities
A possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of
the Company or; present obligation that arises from past events where it is not probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or the amount of
the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability are disclosed as contingent liability and
not provided for. Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements
345Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
Where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits
expected to be received under such contract, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and
measured as a provision
xxii. Commitments
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual expenditure, classified and disclosed as follows:
a) b) c) estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and not provided for;
funding related commitment to subsidiaries/associates; and
other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the extent they are considered material and relevant
in the opinion of management.
d) other commitments related to sales/procurements made in the normal course of business are not
disclosed to avoid excessive details.
e) f) commitments under Loan agreement to disburse Loans
lease agreements entered but not executed
xxiii. Statement of Cash Flows
Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating the cash flows into operating, investing and financing
activities. Cash flow from operating activities is reported using indirect method adjusting the net profit for
the effects of:
i. ii. changes during the period in operating receivables and payables transactions of a non-cash nature;
non-cash items such as depreciation, Impairment, deferred taxes, unrealised foreign currency gains
and losses, and undistributed profits of associates and joint ventures; and
iii. all other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents (including bank balances) shown in the Statement of Cash Flows exclude
items which are not available for general use as on the date of Balance Sheet.
xxiv. Dividend payable
Interim dividend declared to equity shareholders, if any, is recognised as liability in the period in which the
said dividend has been declared by the Board of Directors. Final dividend declared, if any, is recognised
in the period in which the said dividend has been approved by the Shareholders.
The dividend payable is recognised as a liability with a corresponding amount recognised directly in
equity.
Cumulative Redeemable Preference shares (CRPS) is classified as a financial liability as per Ind AS 109
and dividend accrued on such instrument is recorded as Finance cost.
xxv. Business combinations of entities under common control:
Business combinations involving entities that are controlled by the Group are accounted for using the
pooling of interest method. Assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying
value without adjustments being made to reflect fair values. The identity of the reserve are preserved
and reserve of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee. The difference, if any, between the
amounts recorded as share capital issued and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred
to capital reserve. The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior period is restated
as if the business combination had occurred form the beginning of the preceding period in the financial
statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination.

as the terms of the forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps contract match that
of the foreign currency borrowings. The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging
relationships as the underlying risk of the forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency
swaps are identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses
the dollar offset method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against
the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The hedge ineffectiveness
can arise mainly if there is a change in the credit risk of the Company or the counterparty.

Note 33: Employee Benefit Expenses
A. Defined contribution plans
1) Superannuation Fund
The Company makes contribution towards superannuation fund, a defined contribution retirement
plan for qualifying employees. The Superannuation fund is administered by superannuation fund
set up as Trust by the Company. The Company is liable to pay to the superannuation fund to the
extent of the amount contributed. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense in
the year of contribution. The Company has recognised ` 1.55 crore (Year ended 31 March 2023
` 1.55 crore) for Superannuation Fund contributions in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
B. Defined benefit plan
1) Provident Fund
The Company makes Provident Fund contributions, a defined contribution plan for qualifying
employees. Under the Schemes, both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at
a specified percentage of the covered employees’ salary (currently 12% of employees’ salary). The
contributions, except that the employer’s contribution towards pension fund is paid to the Regional
Provident Fund office, as specified under the law, are made to the provident fund set up as an
irrevocable trust by the Company. The interest rate payable to the members of the trust shall not be
lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government under the Employees
Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good
by the Company. Hence the Company is liable for annual contributions and any deficiency in
interest cost compared to interest computed based on the rate of interest declared by the Central
Government. The total liability in respect of the interest shortfall of the Fund is determined on
the basis of an actuarial valuation. The interest liability arising only to the extent of the aforesaid
differential shortfalls is a defined benefit plan. There is no such shortfall as at March 31, 2024.
Effective January 1st, 2024, Tata Capital Financial Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company and Tata Cleantech Capital Limited, a subsidiary of the Company have merged with
the Company under a scheme of arrangement approved by the NCLT vide order dated November
24, 2023. The Provident Fund contributions, for qualifying employees of the erstwhile company Tata
Cleantech Capital Limited for the period upto the effective date of merger i.e. January 1, 2024 was
paid to provident fund administered by the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.
The Provident Fund contributions along with the interest shortfall if any are recognized as an expense
in the year in which it is determined. The Company has recognised ` 44.24 crore (Year ended 31
March 2023 ` 32.10 crore) for Provident Fund contributions and ` Nil (Year ended 31 March 2023 `
Nil) for interest shortfalls in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2) Gratuity
The Company offers its employees defined benefit plans in the form of a gratuity scheme (a lump-
sum amount). Benefits under the defined benefit plans are typically based on years of service and the
employee’s compensation (generally immediately before retirement). The gratuity scheme covers
substantially all regular employees. Commitments are actuarially determined at year-end. These
commitments are valued at the present value of the expected future payments, with consideration for
calculated future salary increases, using a discount rate corresponding to the interest rate estimated
by the actuary having regard to the interest rate on Government bonds with a remaining term that is
almost equivalent to the average balance working period of employees. Actuarial valuation is done
based on “Projected Unit Credit” method. Gains and losses of changed actuarial assumptions are
recorded in the Other Comprehensive Income. The Company provides gratuity for employees in
India as per payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity scheme for employees is as under:
389Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Eligibility Continuous service for 5 years (not applicable in case of death or disability
while in service)
Benefit payable upon Benefit payable Retirement, Withdrawal, Death/Disability
For service less than 10 years: 15/26 X Salary X Service
For service greater than 10 years: Salary X Service
Salary definition Last drawn monthly basic salary + Dearness Allowance
Service definition Number of years of service rounded to the nearest integer
Normal retirement age 60 years
There are no statutory minimum funding requirements for gratuity plans mandated in India. However,
a Company can fund the benefits by way of a separate irrevocable Trust to take advantage of tax
exemptions and also to ensure security of benefits.
The Tata Capital Limited Gratuity Scheme is funded by way of a separate irrevocable Trust and the
Company is expected to make regular contributions to the Trust. The fund is managed internally by
the Company and the assets are invested as per the pattern prescribed under Rule 67 of Income Tax
Rules, 1962. The asset allocation of the Trust is set by Trustees from time to time, taking into account
the membership profile, the liquidity requirements of the plan and risk appetite of the plan sponsor as per
the investment norms. Each year asset-liability matching study is performed in which the consequences
of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and
Contribution policies are integrated within this study.
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of
which are detailed below:
1. 2. 3. Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government
bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
Salary Inflation risk : Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit
obligation
Demographic risk : This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements
that include mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on
the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and depends upon the combination of salary
increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals because in
the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically costs less per year
as compared to a long service employee.
4. 5. Investment risk : For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets
certified by the insurer may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases,
the present value of the assets is independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide
fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount rate
during the inter-valuation period.
Legislative risk : Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan
assets due to change in the legislation/regulation. The government may amend the Payment of
Gratuity Act, 1972, thus requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to the employees. This
will directly affect the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the same will have to be
390NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 34: Fair Values Of Financial Instruments
A. Valuation models
The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance
of the inputs used in making the measurements:
a) b) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the Company can access at measurement date.
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes
instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted
prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other
valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market
data.
c) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the valuation of assets or liabilities that the Company
can access at measurement date. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation
technique includes inputs that are not observable and the unobservable inputs have a significant
effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on
quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions
394NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
are required to reflect differences between the instruments. Valuation techniques include net present
value and discounted cash flow models, income approach, comparison with similar instruments
for which observable market prices exist, option pricing models and other valuation models.
Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free returns, benchmark interest
rates and credit spreads used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency
exchange rates, equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company uses widely recognised valuation models to determine the fair value of financial
instruments, such as forward rate agreement, that use only observable market data and require little
management judgement and estimation. Observable prices or model inputs are usually available in
the market for listed equity securities. The availability of observable market prices and model inputs
reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and also reduces the uncertainty
associated with determining fair values.
For more complex instruments, the Company uses proprietary valuation models, which are usually
developed from recognised valuation models. Some or all of the significant inputs into these models
may not be observable in the market, and may be derived from market prices or rates or estimated
based on assumptions. Valuation models that employ significant unobservable inputs require a higher
degree of management judgement and estimation in the determination of fair value. Management
judgement and estimation are usually required for the selection of the appropriate valuation model
to be used, determination of expected future cash flows on the financial instrument being valued,
determination of the probability of counterparty default and prepayments, determination of expected
volatilities and correlations and selection of appropriate discount rates.
Fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity
risk or model uncertainties, to the extent that the Company believes that a third party market
participant would take them into account in pricing a transaction. Fair values reflect the credit
risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Company
and the counterparty where appropriate. Model inputs and values are calibrated against historical
data, where possible, against current or recent observed transactions in different instruments. This
calibration process is inherently subjective and it yields ranges of possible inputs and estimates of
fair value, and management uses judgement to select the most appropriate point in the range.
Discounting of the cash flows of financial asset/ financial liability for computing the fair value of such
instrument: the future contractual cash flows of instrument over the remaining contractual life of the
instrument are discounted using comparable rate of lending/borrowing as applicable to financial
asset/ financial liability in the month of reporting for a similar class of instruments. For shorter tenure
financial assets such as channel finance, the remaining tenure is assumed to be six months.
Derivatives held for risk management :
The Company enters into derivatives to mitigate the currency exchange risk and interest rate risk
on account of fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates and floating rates towards the principal and
interest repayments of external commercial borrowing. Some of these instruments are valued using
models with significant unobservable inputs, principally expected long-term volatilities and expected
correlations between different underlyings.
In the valuation of derivative instruments, the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method plays a pivotal
role. This method involves projecting the future cash flows that the derivative is expected to generate
or obligate over its life. These cash flows are then discounted back to the present value using an
appropriate discount rate, which reflects the risk profile of the cash flows and the time value of
395Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
money.
The discount rate is typically derived from market-based inputs to ensure an objective valuation. In
the context of derivatives, the DCF method accounts for various factors such as underlying asset
price movements, interest rate changes, and volatility, as well as contractual terms of the derivative.
The strength of the DCF approach lies in its flexibility to model the unique features of derivatives,
including embedded options.
B. Valuation framework
The Company has a established a policy for the measurement of fair values addressing the
requirement to independently verify the results of all significant fair value measurements.
Specific controls include:
1) 3) 4) 5) 6) verification of observable pricing basis actual market transactions;
2) re-performance of model valuations;
a review and approval process for new models and changes to models
annual calibration and back-testing of models against observed market transactions;
analysis and investigation of significant annual valuation movements; and
review of significant unobservable inputs, valuation adjustments and significant changes to the
fair value measurement of Level 3 instruments compared with the previous year.
When third party information, such as valuation agency report is used to measure fair value, the
Company assesses the documents and evidence used to support the conclusion that the valuations
meet the requirements of Ind AS. This includes:
1) understanding how the fair value has been arrived at, the extent to which it represents actual
market transactions and whether it represents a quoted price in an active market for an identical
instrument;
2) 3) when prices for similar instruments are used to measure fair value, how these prices have been
adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the instrument subject to measurement; and
if a number of quotes for the same financial instrument have been obtained, then how fair value
has been determined using those quotes.

The Company has not disclosed fair values for cash and cash equivalents, other balances with bank,
trade and other receivables, other financial assets, trade and other payables, lease liabilities and other
financial liabilities because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Investment in subsidiaries and associates:
The Company has elected to measure Investment in subsidiaries and associates at cost and accordingly
the requirement of disclosure of fair value of the instrument under Ind AS 107 does not apply.
Fair value of the Financial instruments measured at amortised cost
The fair value of loans given is based on observable market transactions, to the extent available.
Wherever the observable market transactions are not available, fair value is estimated using valuation
models, such as discounted cash flow techniques. Input into the valuation techniques includes interest
rates, prepayment rates, primary origination or secondary market spreads. Input into the models may
include information obtained from other market participants, which includes observed primary and
secondary transactions.
To improve the accuracy of the valuation estimate for retail and smaller commercial loans, homogeneous
loans are grouped into portfolios with similar characteristics such as product.
The fair value of borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques, applying the rates that
are offered for borrowings of similar maturities and terms.
T bills and Government securities are valued based on market quotes.

ii Derivatives held for risk management purposes, not designated as hedging instruments:
The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk related to external commercial borrowings and the
primary risk of change in the floating interest rate and payment in foreign currency towards principal and
interest at future date is managed by entering into a interest rate swap and foreign exchange forward
rate purchase agreement respectively.
The Corporation’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk is explained in Note
35.
The cross currency interest rate swap and foreign exchange forward currency agreements are entered
to fully hedge the risk on account of change in interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations on account
of the external commercial borrowings.
Interest rate swap has been taken in respect of the same contract for which forward contract has been
entered, accordingly notional value of Interest rate swap is not shown separately
Collateral and other credit enhancements
The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counter-
party.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows:
For corporate and small business lending, first charge over real estate properties, plant and machineries,
inventory and trade receivables, equity and debt securities, floating charge over the corporate assets are
obtained. For Construction equipment finance, the asset is hypothecated to the Company.

The Companies collection policy is to pursue timely realisation of the collateral in an orderly manner. The
Company upon a customer account becoming delinquent, undertakes the process to physically repossess
properties or other assets with the help of external agents to recover funds, to settle outstanding debt.
Any surplus funds if any received are returned to the customers/obligors. As a result of this practice,
the residential properties, vehicles, construction equipments and tractors under legal repossession
processes are not recorded on the balance sheet and not treated as non–current assets held for sale.
Asset in the form of real estate property, plant and machinery, equity shares and debt securities received
upon final settlement of the loan is recorded as non-current assets held for sale
Management monitors the market value of collateral as per the Credit monitoring process and will request
additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement as applicable.
As on March 31, 2024, the Company has given loan against shares / equity oriented mutual funds / debt
securities amounting to ` 10,167.70 crore. The customer has the obligation to maintain Loan to Value
(LTV) of 50% as per RBI norms for shares and equity oriented mutual funds at any point in time, failing
which the Company has right to make good the shortfall within 7 working days.
The Company has written-off loans of ` 505.25 crore in financial year ended March 31, 2024 (March 31,
2023 : ` 345.56 crore). The Company retains its contractual right against the obligor and may pursue all
remedies to recover these dues.

iii Amounts arising from ECL
Impairment allowance on financial asset is covered in note 2 (xi) Inputs, assumptions and estimation
techniques used for estimating ECL
1) Inputs:
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly
since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is
relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative
information and analysis based on the Company’s historical experience, expert credit assessment
and including forward looking information.
The Company allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on days past due, which is a
quantitative factor that indicates the risk of default. Additional qualitative factors are applied such as
fraudulent customer, reschedulement of loans and discontinued portfolios are also considered as
qualitative factor.
These factors are applied uniformly for each lending product. Upon review the committee may
conclude that the account qualifies for classification as stage 2 since there is increase in credit risk.
The determination of the credit risk is for each product, considering the unique risk and rewards
associated with it. The Company has observed varied level of risk across various buckets within each
stage and a significant increase in risk in stage 2, based on assessment of qualitative parameters
such as decline in net-worth, downgrade in internal ratings and external ratings for Corporate and
SME Finance Division.
The objective of the ECL assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has
occurred for an exposure by comparing the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the
reporting date; with the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of
initial recognition of the exposure and adjusted for changes on account of prepayments.
413Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In assessing the impairment of loan assets under expected credit loss (ECL) Model, the loans have
been segmented into three stages based on the risk profiles. The three stages reflect the general
pattern of credit deterioration of a financial instrument.
Refer note 2(xi) in Significant accounting policies for definition of Stages of Asset
2) Assumptions:
The Company has applied following assumptions for determination of ECL.
a) b) “Loss given default” (LGD) is an estimate of loss from a transaction given that a default occurs.
“Probability of default” (PD) is defined as the probability of whether the borrowers will default on
their obligations in the future. For assets which are in Stage 1, a 12-month PD is required. For
Stage 2 assets a lifetime PD is required while Stage 3 assets are considered to have a 100%
PD.
c) “Exposure at default”” (EAD) represents the expected exposure in the event of a default and is
the gross carrying amount in case of the financial assets held by the Company including loan
commitments.
d) Definition of default: A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails to make the
contractual payments within 90 days of when they fall due. Accordingly, the financial assets
shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the reporting date, it has been more than 90 days past
due. Further if the customer has requested forbearance in repayment terms, such restructured,
rescheduled or renegotiated accounts are also classified as Stage 3. Non-payment on another
obligation of the same customer is also considered as a stage 3. Defaulted accounts include
customers reported as fraud in the Fraud Risk Management Committee (FRMC). Once an
account defaults as a result of the Days past due condition, it will be considered to be cured
only when entire arrears of interest and principal are paid by the borrower.
e) Forward looking information
The Company incorporates forward looking information into both assessments of whether
the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its
measurement of ECL. Based on the consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast
information, the Company forms a ‘base case’ view of the future direction of relevant economic
variables such as real GDP, domestic credit growth, money market interest rate etc. as well as
a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios. This process involves developing
two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of each
outcome. The base case represents a most likely outcome in a normal distribution curve while
the other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic outcomes. More weight is
applied to pessimistic outcome consistently as a matter of prudence than optimistic outcome.
f) Assessment of significant increase in credit risk
The credit risk on a financial asset of the Company are assumed to have increased significantly
since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Additionally,
accounts identified and reviewed by the Executive committee for labelling as breaching pre-
defined critical credit risk parameters will also be classified as stage 2. Accordingly, the financial
assets shall be classified as Stage 2, based on the quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
3) Estimation techniques:
The Company has applied the following estimation technique for ECL model:
a) The Company has used historic default rates for calculating the 12-month PD and Lifetime PDs
b) Loss given default is calculated after considering outstanding at the time of default and adjusting
for actual recoveries basis time value of money,
414NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
c) Credit risk monitoring techniques
Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may indicate that a significant increase in
credit risk has occurred on an exposure. The monitoring typically involves use of the following
data for Corporate and Retail exposures:
i) Overdue status
ii) Restructuring, reschedulement of loans and requests for granting of forbearance
iii) Fraudulent customer
iv) Exit directed by the Risk Management Committee
v) Accounts classified by SICR committee indicating significant increase in credit risk
vi) Information published in the Basel IRB (Basel internal rating based approach refers to set
of credit measurement techniques proposed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision
(BCBS) for determining capital adequacy of the bank) norms is also used.
d) Days past due are a primary input for the determination of the PD for exposures. The Company
collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by
product. For some portfolios, information published in Basel IRB norms is also used.
e) The Company employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates
of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result
of the passage of time. Such statistical models are selected considering the availability of
information related to the probability of default for each product.
This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in
default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors. Key macro-economic indicators
includes but are not limited to Private consumption, Real GDP, Consumer prices, Long-term
bond yield, Unemployment rate, Gross fixed investment rate etc.
For the purpose of determination of impact of forward looking information, the Company applies
various macro economic (ME) variables as stated above to each product and assess the trend
of the historical probability of defaults as compared to the forecasted probability of default.
Based on the directional trend of output, management applies an overlay if required. Overtime,
new ME variable may emerge to have a better correlation and may replace ME being used
now.
f) g) h) i) Based on advice from the external risk management experts, the Company considered variety
of external actual and forecast information to formulate a ‘base case’ view of the future direction
of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast
scenarios. Such forecasts are adjusted to estimate the PDs.
Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on various
portfolios of financial assets have been developed based on analysing historical data over the
past 5 years.
A maximum of a 12-month PD or actual contractual tenure is considered for financial assets for
which credit risk has not significantly increased. The Company measures ECL for stage 2 and
stage 3 assets considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period over which
it is exposed to credit risk.
The loans are segmented into homogenous product categories and further risk-based cohorts
(for certain products) to determine the historical PD/LGD. This segmentation is subject to
regular review.
415Annual Report 2023-24
NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
j) For portfolios in respect of which the Company has limited historical data, external benchmark
information is used to supplement the internally available data.
k) Techniques for determining LGD
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Company estimates LGD
parameters based on the history of recovery rates against defaulted counterparties. The LGD
models consider the cash flow received and assets received in lieu of settlement of loan. LGD
estimates are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the contractual interest rate
(approximation to expected EIR) as the discounting factor. The Company has adopted collection
curve method for computation of loss given defaults to determine expected credit losses. In the
Absence of observed history of default, LGD applied is based on Basel IRB norms for certain
products.
l) Techniques for computation of EAD
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Company derives the
EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross
carrying amount. For lending commitments, the EAD includes the amount drawn, as well as
potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on
credit conversion factor for various loan commitments.
When estimating ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the company estimates the expected
portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. ECL is the
present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Company
if the holder of the commitment draws down the loan and the cash flows that the Company
expects to receive if the loan is drawn down.
4) Modified financial assets:
The Company renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as forbearance
activities, restructuring or rescheduling) to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of
default. Under the Companies forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if
the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that
the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is
expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments
and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the
forbearance policy. The Risk Management Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance
activities.
Upon renegotiation, such accounts are classified as stage 3. Such accounts are upgraded to stage
1 only upon observation of satisfactory repayments for at least one year from the commencement
of the first payment of interest or principal (whichever is later).
Pursuant to RBI Covid restructuring policy, accounts for which Covid restructuring facility were given
have been reclassified from Stage I to Stage II if DPD at invocation was between 0-30 and If the
DPD was 30+ then the accounts were further downgraded within Stage II and corresponding staging
wise ECL provision was done.

As at March 31, 2024, claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts in respect of income
tax matters amounted to ` 220.29 crore. These claims against the Company are arising on account of
multiple issues of disallowances on completion of assessment proceedings under the Income-tax Act,
1961, such as disallowance of expenditure incurred in relation to income not includible in total income
u/s 14A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and disallowance of interest expenditure on perpetual NCDs. These
matters are pending before various appellate authorities and the Management expect that its position
will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position. Hence, the Company has not recognized these uncertain tax positions in its books.

Finance Limited ` 1,200 Crore (As at March 31, 2023 : ` 1200 Crore) against which the amount liable by

Committee (ALCO) in accordance with the Board approved policies.
As per the RBI circular dated 4th Nov 2019 circular no RBI/2019-20/88 DOR.NBFC (PD) CC.
No.102/03.10.001/2019-20 all non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of ` 10,000 crore and above,
and all deposit taking NBFCs irrespective of their asset size, shall maintain a liquidity buffer in terms of
LCR which will promote resilience of NBFCs to potential liquidity disruptions by ensuring that they have
sufficient High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) to survive any acute liquidity stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
Road Map for NBFCs to adhere the LCR is as per the table (as prescribed by RBI).
From 1-Dec-20 1-Dec-21 1-Dec-22 1-Dec-23 1-Dec-24
Minimum LCR 50% 60% 70% 85% 100%
As per the above requirement, Tata Capital Ltd is required to maintain LCR from 1 December 2020.
Therefore, for the year ended 31 March 2024, the Company has disclosed the LCR as a simple average
of all days in 3 months within a quarter for all four quarters of FY 23-24.
LCR maintained: Starting in Dec 2020, LCR has been computed as per methodology prescribed in the
RBI circular dated 4 November 2019. For the quarter ended March 24, the simple average of all days in
the past three months was observed at 112% (HQLA- ` 2,995 crore) against the requirement of minimum
85% (HQLA - ` 2,279 crore). For the year FY24, the company has been consistently compliant with LCR
framework for all 4 quarters.
Main drivers to the LCR numbers: All significant outflows and inflows determined in accordance with RBI
guidelines are included in the prescribed LCR computation.
Intra-period changes and changes over time: As per RBI guidelines, the company has been monitoring
the LCR on a daily basis for the period of April 23 to March 24. For Q4 FY24, the maximum and minimum
required HQLA observed for regulatory compliance was ` 2,760 crore and ` 1,664 crore respectively.
Composition of HQLA: The HQLA maintained by TCL comprises Government securities (including SDL
and Treasury bills) and cash balance maintained in current account.
The details are given below.

` 5.55 crore in cash and remaining ` 2,989.87 crore from Government securities and T bill.
Concentration of funding sources:
The company maintains diversified sources of funding comprising short/long term loans from banks,
NCDs, sub-ordinated and perpetual debt, ECBs and CPs. The funding pattern is reviewed regularly by
the management.
Derivative exposures and potential collateral calls:
The company has fully hedged interest and principal outflows on the foreign currency ECBs. ECBs
constitutes no more than 9.85% of the total borrowings as on 31st March, 2024. Hence, derivative
exposures are considered NIL.
500NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

since FCY ECBs are fully hedged for the corresponding interest and principal components. With respect
to Letters of credits and buyers credit, the Company does a monthly assessment to evaluate the net
outflows or inflows and if material the same is considered in the LCR computation. For the month of
March 24, the Company has assessed the impact to be immaterial.
Other inflows and outflows in the LCR calculation that are not captured in the LCR common template but
which the institution considers to be relevant for its liquidity profile. NIL as on 31st March 2024.”
